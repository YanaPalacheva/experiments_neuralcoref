# RuCor4NeuralCoref: RuCor corpus adapted to NeuralCoref coreference resulution pipeline.

This notebook is mailnly based on [rucor_to_conllu](https://github.com/fostroll/rucor_to_conllu): RuCor corpus to CoNLL-U format conversion script.

This adaptation is supposed to convert [RuCor](http://rucoref.maimbava.net/): Russian language corpus annotated with coreferential relations
to the suitable for [NeuralCoref](https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref): a pipeline for coreference resolution.
