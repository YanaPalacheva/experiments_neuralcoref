Could the collapse of I-880 have been prevented #Gen:ACT ?
That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking #Cor:PAT themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome #Cor:ADDR task of #Cor:ACT trying to #Cor:ACT extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that caved in during Tuesday's temblor.
After #Cor:ACT touring the area, California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway's collapse, #Cor:ACT blaming the disaster on substandard construction, the Associated Press reported #Gen:ADDR .
The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured #Gen:ACT in #Gen:ACT lost #Cor:PAT lives.
But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California's infrastructure to #Cor:ACT withstand a major temblor.
It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps #Gen:ADDR connect #Cor:ACT Oakland with San Francisco is reopened #Gen:ACT , and the cost to #Cor:ACT build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $250 million, said #Gen:ADDR Charles J. O'Connell, deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation, #Gen:ACT nicknamed #Cor:PAT Caltrans.
Caltrans in Sacramento said #Gen:ADDR total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated #Gen:ACT at around $500 million.
The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well, as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans #Gen:ACT to #Cor:ACT bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994.
Caltrans plans to #Cor:ACT add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5-mile stretch of the Harbor Freeway just south of Los Angeles, near the Memorial Coliseum.
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn yesterday vowed to #Cor:ACT fight the introduction of double-decking in the area.
Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles, Mr. O'Connell explained #Gen:ADDR .
That temblor measured 6.1 on the Richter scale; Tuesday's was #PersPron:PAT
So why even consider #Gen:ACT #Gen:ACT stacking freeways now?
``We've run out of places to #Gen:ACT build freeways in L.A., and the only place to go #Gen:ACT is up,'' Mr. O'Connell said #Gen:ADDR , although he acknowledges there are many obstacles, including cost.
But as for safety, he says #Gen:ADDR double-deck freeways built #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT today with the heavily #Gen:ACT reinforced #Cor:PAT concrete and thicker columns #Gen:ACT required #Cor:PAT after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale.
Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday.
But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or ``liquefy #PersPron:ACT,'' in a major quake.
The two-story roadway, designed in the mid-1940s and #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT completed in 1957, was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT in highways today.
While the pillars did have long metal bars #Cor:ACT running vertically through them for reinforcement, they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal ``ties'' that run horizontally through the column, said #Gen:ADDR Leo Parker, a structural engineer in Los Angeles.
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes #Cor:PAT , with spiraling steel rods inside.
But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, #Cor:ACT crushing motorists who were lined #Gen:ACT up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below.
Officials of the state agency didn't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement didn't hold up .
Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $55 million statewide project, #Cor:ACT using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns #Cor:ACT and prevent the structure from swaying #Cor:ACT in a quake.
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago in Sacramento declined to #Cor:ACT identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work.
Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took ``reasonable care'' to build #Cor:ACT and maintain the structures, says #Gen:ADDR John Messina, a Tacoma, Wash., personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases.
The firm brought #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT in to #Cor:ACT strengthen the structure could be liable as well.
The results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken #Gen:PAT #Gen:ACT , Mr. Messina says #Gen:ADDR .
Given the seismic history of the Bay Area, ``it seems to me that a 6.9 earthquake is a foreseeable event.''
Caltrans' Mr. Drago defended #Gen:EFF the agency's work on the Nimitz Freeway.
``The work was done #Gen:ACT properly,'' he said #Gen:ADDR .
``Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure couldn't withstand #Cor:PAT .''
Ironically, Caltrans this year began #Cor:ACT working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time #Cor:ACT wrapping freeway columns in ``steel blankets'' to #Cor:ACT reinforce them.
But only bridges supported #Cor:PAT with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported #Cor:PAT by double rows, was #Gen:ACT left out, Mr. Drago explained #Gen:ADDR .
``The reason is that the technology is such that we're not able to #Cor:ACT retrofit #Gen:ADDR multi-column structures,'' he said #Gen:ADDR .
