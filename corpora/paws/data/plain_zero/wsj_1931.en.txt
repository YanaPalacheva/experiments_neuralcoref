The dollar finished #Gen:PAT softer yesterday, tilted lower by continued concern about the stock market.
``We're trading #Gen:PAT with a very wary eye on Wall Street,'' said #Gen:ADDR Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader at Harris Trust&Savings Bank in New York.
``No one is willing #Cor:ACT to #Cor:ACT place a firm bet that the stock market won't take another tumultuous ride.''
News of the major earthquake in California Tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early Asian trade, but most foreign-exchange dealers said #Gen:ADDR they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short-lived.
Despite the dollar's lackluster performance, some foreign-exchange traders maintain that the U.S. unit remains relatively well #Gen:ACT bid #Cor:PAT #Gen:EFF.
Harris Trust's Mr. Woodland noted that the unit continues to #Cor:ACT show resilience in the face of a barrage of ``headline negatives'' in recent weeks, including #PersPron:ACT rate increases in Europe and Japan, aggressive central bank intervention, a 190-point plunge in New York stock prices, an unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report and action by the Federal Reserve to #PersPron:ACT nudge U.S. rates lower.
While Mr. Woodland doesn't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world, he noted that ``its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- ``impressively'' limited.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8485 marks, down from 1.8667 marks late Tuesday, and at 141.45 yen, down from 142.75 yen late Tuesday.

In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for #Gen:ACT trading #Gen:PAT at 140.97 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen.
Since Friday's dive in stock market prices, the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an #Cor:ACT effort to calm the markets #Cor:ACT and avert a repeat of 1987's stock market debacle.
Some analysts note that after last week's stock market tailspin and Tuesday's California earthquake, it 's hard to #Cor:ACT gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate .
They say #Gen:ADDR that the earthquake, by preventing #Cor:ACT many banks from operating #Cor:ACT at full capacity, has given the Fed an additional reason #Cor:ACT to #Cor:ACT keep liquidity at a high level .
The Fed did, in fact, execute $1.5 billion of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements, the third set of repurchase orders in three days.
Analysts said #Gen:ADDR the additional liquidity should tend to #Cor:ACT reduce the federal funds rate.
For now, traders say #Gen:ADDR the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street.
They note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad news from the stock exchange.
Indeed, the U.S. unit edged lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 13 points in early trading.
A slight recovery in the stock market gave currency traders confidence #Cor:ACT to #Cor:ACT push the dollar higher before the unit dropped back by day's end .
Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that appeared #Gen:PAT to advise Japanese investors to #Cor:ACT be very careful in #PersPron:ACT investing #Gen:PAT in U.S. leveraged buy-outs.
Dealers suggest #Gen:ADDR that the only positive news on the horizon that could detract attention from equities transactions is September's U.S. consumer price data.
The figures, due for release Friday, are #Gen:ACT expected to show an uptick in inflation to 4.8% from 4.7% in August.
If the figures show a hefty rise in inflation, they could militate against easing by the Fed.
