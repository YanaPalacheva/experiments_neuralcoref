A new drug to #Cor:ACT prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used #Gen:ACT on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh, according to researchers.
The drug, which is still in the experimental phase, hasn't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration, and its long-term effects are unknown.
But researchers say #Gen:ADDR the drug, #Gen:ACT called #Cor:PAT FK-506, could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects #Cor:ACT and by lowering rejection rates.
Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT world-wide each year.
Researchers began #Cor:ACT using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney, liver, heart and pancreas transplants.
Only two of 111 transplants have been #Gen:ACT rejected .
The drug, discovered #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT in 1984, is #Gen:ACT metabolized from soil fungus found #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT in Japan.
The Pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given #Gen:ACT #Cor:ADDR the drug, which is made by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.
``We're shocked by it, because it's worked so fast,'' said #Gen:ADDR Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program, at a news conference here yesterday.
``We consider it a life-saving drug, like one for AIDS,'' said #Gen:ADDR Dr. John Fung, an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh.
Researchers say #Gen:ADDR they believe FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug, cyclosporine, made #Cor:PAT by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd.
They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506, compared with cyclosporine, which can cause renal failure, morbidity, nausea and other problems.
``The side effects -LCB- of cyclosporine -RCB- have made the penalty for its success rather high,'' Dr. Starzl said #Gen:ADDR .
Dr. Fung said #Gen:ADDR that FK-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year, and that the FDA approval process usually takes three years to five years.
There are no firm plans #Gen:ACT to #Cor:ACT expand the experimental program beyond the University of Pittsburgh, whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world.
Researchers couldn't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said #Gen:ADDR FK-506 will enable patients to #Cor:ACT cut hospital stays by 50% and reduce the number of blood tests #Gen:ACT used #Cor:PAT to #PersPron:ACT monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients.
Dr. Starzl said #Gen:ADDR the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds, and that Fujisawa didn't give the hospital any grants.
He said #Gen:ADDR that the research team had no financial stake in the drug.
``We've known for six months the effect of this drug, and our advice to our people has been not to #PersPron:ACT buy the company's stock,'' Dr. Starzl said #Gen:ADDR , #Cor:ACT adding that #Gen:ACT profiting from FK-506 wouldn't be ethical.
