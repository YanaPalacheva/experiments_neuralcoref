Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co., #Cor:ACT saying #Gen:ADDR the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers.
The commission, which was asked to #Cor:ACT study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February, said #Gen:ADDR the diversity of global supply of chemicals #Gen:ACT used #Cor:PAT in #Cor:ACT making analgesic drugs was great enough to #PersPron:ACT offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain #Cor:PAT through the acquisition.
The French chemical giant would hold an 80% share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid, methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin.
The commission found that if the British government attempted to #Cor:ACT block the merger, Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond #PersPron:PAT by #Cor:ACT closing the salicylates plant Monsanto operates #Cor:PAT in Wales, removing #Cor:ACT the matter from U.K. jurisdiction.
