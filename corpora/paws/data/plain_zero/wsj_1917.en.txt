Lionel Corp.'s board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million, for as much as 90% of Lionel by a group with a 9.9% stake in the toy retailer.
Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to #Cor:ACT tender their securities, #Cor:ACT saying #Gen:ADDR it wants to #Cor:ACT remain independent to #Cor:ACT pursue its business strategy.
Lionel also said #Gen:ADDR the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate, and full of conditions that leave it ``subject to substantial uncertainty.''
In addition, Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking #Cor:ACT to #Cor:ACT enjoin the offer, #Cor:ACT alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel's securities.
Robert I. Toussie, general partner of the investment group, said #Gen:ADDR the Lionel response reflected management's #Gen:ACT entrenched #Cor:PAT position, #Cor:ACT saying #Gen:ADDR officials had failed to #Cor:ACT come up with a better alternative to his group's offer.
Mr. Toussie said #Gen:ADDR he would respond #Gen:EFF to Lionel's suit after his lawyers review it.
