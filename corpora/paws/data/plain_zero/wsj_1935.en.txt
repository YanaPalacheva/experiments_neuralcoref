Economist David N. Laband's Sept. 27 editorial-page article, ``In Hugo's Path, a Man-Made Disaster,'' decries the control of price gouging, swiftly ordered #Gen:ADDR #Cor:PAT by South Carolina's governor after Hurricane Hugo.
According to Mr. Laband, `` #Gen:ACTscreaming'' for price controls occurs when income redistribution ``threatens to #Cor:ACT hit home .''
To be #Gen:ACT sure, the threat has hit home down here.
Yet in Mr. Laband's rehash of free-market logic, human greed and self-interest are the only permissible psychological reactions.
Allowing #Gen:ACT uncontrolled prices for necessities would indeed shorten the lines at stores, as he contends #PersPron:PAT #Gen:ADDR .
But not because resources are going to their most efficient use, leaving #Cor:ACT scarce goods ``allocated #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT to those buyers who place the highest value on them.''
Rather, lines would diminish because at higher prices many victims could not afford necessities such as food and medical supplies.
It is inhumane to #Gen:ACT imply that a poor, unemployed woman can not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much to #Cor:ACT protect #Cor:PAT as a rich family.
Moreover, essential relief supplies such as ice must be #Gen:ACT distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease.
Such spillover effects give the state a #Cor:ACT right to intervene in the marketplace #Cor:ACT and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources.
Fortunately, volunteers and charities are not motivated #Gen:ACT by self-interest, but by altruism.
Why should they have to #Cor:ACT co-exist with opportunists #Cor:ACT rushing in to #Cor:ACT turn a quick profit ?
These latter-day scalawags would be #Cor:ACT ill-advised to #Cor:ACT take advantage of the situation, if they ever expect to #Cor:ACT face the people of South Carolina again.
The government is actually protecting avaricious ice-baggers and other profiteers who can not see beyond their own short-term gain.
South Carolina deserves an A for its quick and timely relief efforts.
Mr. Laband, meanwhile, gets an A for his rote recital of economic-efficiency arguments.
Give #PersPron:ACT him an F for his failure to #Cor:ACT understand the ethics of economic equity.

Mr. Laband gives us an idea why economists' predictions are usually wrong .
They set up absurd situations, #Gen:ACT detached #Cor:PAT from reality, and then try to #Cor:ACT reason #Gen:PAT from them.
I'm surprised he didn't advocate letting #Gen:ACT people loot #Cor:ACT, since that behavior can also be #Gen:ACT foreseen in a disaster and ``every individual has an incentive #Cor:ACT to #Cor:ACT alter the distribution of income in his favor.''
Price controls were ``so fervently embraced by Charleston'' because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting #Gen:ACT.

Mr. Laband described one of the more insidious threats we face #Cor:PAT when dealing #Cor:ACT with disasters such as Hugo -- anti-profiteering ordinances such as that by the Charleston City Council as it thrashed about #Cor:ACT trying to #Cor:ACT Do Something.
Since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinances, he didn't mention certain other of their effects.
They divert law-enforcement resources at a time they are most #Gen:ACT needed for protecting #Cor:ACT lives and property .
Also, rather than increase #PersPron:ACT supplies, they reduce them and encourage hoarding.
And they, or even the prospect of them, discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by merchants.

Would Mr. Laband also suggest #Gen:ADDR that the Red Cross, Salvation Army, military units, police, fire departments, rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to #Cor:ACT assist Hugo's victims because they interfere with his concept of the ``free market''?
What about those caring people all over the country who are donating food, water and other necessities of life to these people who could be any of us?
Should they, too, stop `` #Cor:ACTmessing with'' his free market?
Maybe he thinks they should also sell #Gen:PAT to the highest bidder.
And what about insurance firms?
Should they be required to #Cor:ACT pay claims #Gen:ACT based #Cor:PAT on exorbitant costs for labor and materials?
Mr. Laband should beware, since he lives in South Carolina.
In a free market, his insurance rates can be raised #Gen:ACT to #Cor:ACT recover insurance-company losses.

Having been #Cor:ACT through several tornadoes and hurricanes, I have a different perspective.
Mine comes from seeing #Cor:ACT thriving communities devastated -- #Gen:ACT but only temporarily.
Their recovery came surprisingly fast, and always with the help of neighbors.
The shock of seeing #Gen:ACT homes destroyed #Gen:ACT and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat.
In Texas after Hurricane Alicia, major grocery chains used their truck fleets to #Cor:ACT ship essential goods to Houston, no gouging, just good will.

We here in the affected areas were dazzled by Mr. Laband's analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness #Cor:ACT concerning research and development.
His theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him.
Too bad theory fails in practice.
We consumers tend to #Cor:ACT have long memories.
The businesses #Cor:ACT subscribing to Mr. Laband's effective price system will be remembered #Gen:ACT when normalcy returns .
Perhaps, #Cor:ACT considering the value of our time, we will be unable #Cor:ACT to #Cor:ACT patronize their establishments in the post-Hugo era.
I have a question for Mr. Laband: How do I explain to the single mother of three standing in line next to me for the past three hours that the two bags of ice she needs #Cor:PAT to #Cor:ACT keep her children's food edible will take her last $20 ?
I'm sure she'll appreciate what an efficient reaction to her problems the price system has created .
