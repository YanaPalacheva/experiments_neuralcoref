Governor Richardson well how do you think the North Koreans would react if we took out their test missile /?
Well I respectfully disagree with Assistant Secretary Carter there /.
But at least he 's got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /.
I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened , that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan /. /.
Uh you do take that step /.
but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea /.
and we 've got thirty seven thousand American forces at the DMZ /.
Uh but Tim I think another reason for the face to face talks is that there 're two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /.
one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the North Koreans /.
I believe rightly so /.
but that is a separate bilateral issue /.
The second is our objection to dealing with North Koreans ' request for a light water reactor Which I believe has bogged down the six party talks /.
Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /.
So you ca n't cut them out /.
but I think it 's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea /.
But in the end it 's a judgment of North Korean intentions /.
You 'd been there five times /.
you know them /.
and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said I do n't think they 're going to test /.
And they did /.
No Tim I said I believe that they were going to test /.
I did say that /.
And what I sense in my negotiations in dealing with North Koreans /-
You said as days go by I do n't believe they 're going to do it /.
But early on I said that they did on CBS /.
Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you 're not dealing with individuals like you and me /.
Do n't believe in compromise /.
they believe in their only way or the highway /.
Their view is that their cause is right /.
and they 're going to wait you out /.
So they 're totally unpredictable /.
and I believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the Clinton Administration is direct engagement To get them to curb their nuclear weapons as Bob Gallucci did /.
Secretary Albright almost got a missile agreement /.
Uh Jimmy Carter got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father Kim Jong - Il /.
My point is that face to face discussions with the United States directly I believe is a precursor /.
the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /.
But do they keep their word /?
Here 's Madeline Albright toasting Kim Jong - Il in North Korea October of two thousand /.
She appeared on this program four years later /.
and this was our exchange /.
But did n't North Korea develop a nuclear bomb on Bill Clinton 's watch /?
No what they were doing uh as it turns out , they were cheating /.
and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n't make them with your friends , you make them with your enemies /.
and it is the process that is required to hold uh countries accountable /.
