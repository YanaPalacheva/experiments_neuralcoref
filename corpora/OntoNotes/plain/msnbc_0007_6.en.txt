When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran /.
The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq /.
Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US /.
And both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /.
Now the North Koreans felt I guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.
They 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from the Chinese and the Russians and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what they 've done /.
and you see momentum building in the UN security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /.
The Iranians have miscalculated /.
They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China /.
But we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.
And we 've essentially given the Iranians a clear choice /.
And you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there /.
the Iranians are going to have to choose /.
Negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the Security Council /.
So I do n't think either of these countries is on the offensive /.
Frankly I think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /.
There are very few countries defending them /.
and they 're running out of options /.
So we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /.
And it 's the right way to go clearly for the United States /.
we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /.
Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation /.
the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /.
Do you agree with that /?
I do n't /.
not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran /.
Tim I 've been to Europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese about Iran for instance /.
There 's not a single person at the higher levels of those government who does n't believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability /.
There is n't a single person in the governments of China or Russia or South Korea or Japan who does n't believe that North Korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability /.
There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do /.
There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq /.
In fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /.
And if you look at what the French German and British governments are saying as well as the Russian and Chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /.
So I do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq /.
Let me conclude with comments by Bill Crystal the editor of Weekly Standard /.
he used to work for Vice President Dan Quail /.
North Korea is firing missiles /.
Iran is going nuclear /.
Somalia is controlled by radical Islamists /.
Iraq is n't getting better /.
and Afghanistan is getting worse /.
I give the President a lot of credit for hanging tough on Iraq /.
but I am worried that it has made them too passive in confronting the other threats /.
Have a preoccupation with Iraq allowed North Korea and Iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options /?
Well I strongly disagree with that criticism from Bill Crystal /.
And I disagree for one reason /.
We have a very strong and active government /.
from the Pentagon from the State Department the White House Treasury we are focused on all these problems /.
We created over the last fifteen months a major international coalition to corner the Iranian government And to isolate them /.
And that 's been a diplomatic success over the last several months /.
We 've now got this six party talk framework we hope coming back together /.
and certainly the five countries are united /.
Uh Secretary Rumsfeld was in Afghanistan this morning /.
and Secretary Rice was there ten days ago /.
and we 're giving that government president government all the support it can get /.
We are a government that can operate /.
and we have to operate in every part of the world /.
We 're a global superpower /.
We have tremendous resources at our disposal /.
and frankly we 've got a first class military and a first class diplomatic effort /.
and we can certainly take on all these issues and be successful simultaneously /.
And we will be watching /.
Ambassador Nicholas Burns we thank you for sharing your views /.
Thanks Tim /.
