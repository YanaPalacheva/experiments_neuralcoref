Ahead have New York Times columnists been asked not to write about Judy Miller /?
More of my interview with Tom Friedman next /.
Welcome back to Reliable Sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o'clock eastern /.
More now of my conversation with New York Times columnist Tom Friedman about his book the new online charge to read him and Judy Miller /.
Now your new book The World is Flat I 've got it here /.
uh monster best seller more than a million copies better than any book you 've ever written before /.
Um you were recently profiled about this in Fortune magazine /.
and uh let 's just say that it did n't say you walked on water but it came close /.
Uh but one of the criticisms /-
What 's wrong with that /?
It says that you 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which was news to me /.
Uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that CEOs play a very central role /.
And the suggestion was well CEOs love you , you 're asked to speak at all these corporate events , maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /.
Yeah /.
Mhm /.
Mhm /.
That a reasonable observation /?
Yeah it is a reasonable observation /.
And my reaction to that is look if I want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do I go to /?
do I go to I do n't know Central America /?
Do I go to um uh the factory floor /?
Or do I go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /?
So I make no apology for that at all /.
Um fact I would make a criticism of it /.
There are n't enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /.
Just the opposite /.
We kind of had an Enron effect /.
and Enron effect was all CEOs are guilty unless proven innocent , therefore who wants to talk to them /?
And therefore I would argue -- /.
Wait a second /.
wait a second /.
Journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they 're all bad guys /?
Yeah yeah /.
Yeah I would say /.
uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /.
I would say that there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /.
I would call it a perfect storm /.
One was nine eleven /.
That distracted us okay /.
The other was the Enron effect /.
You know no one wanted to be sort of seen with CEOs /.
And number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.
And as a result I would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we 're going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.
The argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.
And I would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /.
But it 's only had an effect on Tom Friedman 's career /.
In fact you were the Playboy interview /.
Hey put that paper down /.
/.
I bought it for the articles /.
Uh I enjoyed the interview /.
and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and she says do n't publish it /.
Yes she does /.
You go back and rewrite it /.
I 'm afraid I do /.
/.
My wife Andrea edits them all /.
and when she gives me thumbs down Howie I have to put it in a ball throw it in the circular file and start over /.
and she 's a tough editor /.
