Uh-huh .
Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?
Yes .
In terms of citizens ' mentality .
Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .
Time was lost .
Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .
In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .
That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .
I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .
