So I called this woman today
and %um , she 's a dressmaker
and we 're going to go see her next Thursday and talk about her making my wedding dress .
Slate green .
yeah .
%uh .
See , that way I can have exactly what I want .
Exactly .
And it 's only going to be about two hundred and fifty pounds which is about three hundred and fifty dollars .
uh-huh .
So it 's pretty good I mean comparatively .
yeah .
And it 'll be exactly what I want
and it 'll look good on me , you know like fit me , Sure . which is necessary at the moment because I 'm plump
so .
mhm .
Now , daddy got %um the invitations together for you today .
uh-huh .
And in it I put , %um paint samples from Sherwin Williams uh-huh . of all the different like shades of what color I thought you might be thinking of for the bride 's maids .
uh-huh .
oh I already told them all black
but dad does n't want black he said .
Mom and dad wo n't have black .
They do n't want black ?
They 're really opposed to it .
Did you call Sharon and tell her that ?
No .
Could you do that ?
okay .
Could you call Kate and tell her that ?
yeah .
Just say you know my parents are really opposed to black .
yeah .
They wo n't buy me a black dress .
They wo n't ?
Here wait .
Let me look for my phonebook .
No .
Never mind .
I can just open the thing here .
Now wait .
What ,
god we got so much furniture in this tiny apartment .
It 's crazy .
There 's drawers everywhere , to figure out where everything is .
okay .
Let me give you Kate 's phone number .
You can just leave a message .
okay .
okay .
two one , two one two uh-huh . two two six uh-huh . O one two five .
okay .
okay .
I 'll do that .
But %uh ,
yeah ,
apparently like at Lisa Manachi 's wedding like the whole night people were talking about how bad the black dresses were .
Really ?
Like everyone at mom and dad 's table .
yeah .
Who was at mom and dad 's table ?
Weirdo
just all of Lorraine 's friends . mhm . Who you know of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before .
mhm .
But %uh
yeah ,
and Adele still talks about the black dress .
What ?
How hideous they were .
Adele was n't at Lisa Manachi 's .
Adele went to the mass wedding .
She did ?
uh-huh .
oh .
And she wanted me to take her
and I refused to go
and she got mad .
Really ?
Well I said I would not feel comfortable going .
I was not invited . mhm . You know
and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that 's a mass is open to everyone .
I was like well that 's fine
but I would not feel comfortable going .
mhm .
I think that would be obnoxious
and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me .
Right .
To -- -- you know the other thing , the reception .
I just would n't go .
%mm .
So they had to take it down and drive her home .
%mm .
So they 're always kind of pissy at me .
%mm . That 's okay .
yeah .
yeah .
I mean I 've been thinking about it
and the black 's not going to be so hot you know
but
mhm .
yeah .
