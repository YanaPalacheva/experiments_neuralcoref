Incidentally there was some questions uh that Judy Miller would not answer to her colleagues /.
and she would n't share her notes with them although they 've been turned over to the special prosecutor /.
Lucy Dalglish the big news for me was Miller recounting what her lawyer Floyd Abrams had said to her about a conversation that he had with Joe Tate who was Scooter Libby 's lawyer /.
Uh says um Floyd Abrams according to Miller 's account when I would n't give him Tate an assurance that you would exonerate Libby he said do n't go there /.
Now Tate by the way tells the Times that that account is false and outrageous /.
Does this help justify eh Judy Miller 's otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that Scooter Libby offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /?
N- you n- /.
you know I 've been talking to Judy off and on about this case for the last year /.
This was a very difficult decision /.
and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /.
You 'll recall six or eight months ago Howie I was on the show and we were talking about you know did Russert and Kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /?
What I think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the Times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /.
it 's that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /.
Reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /.
Right /.
But these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /.
and we just can tolerate this /.
And we 're trying to /-
I think Lucy 's on to something here if I can just say Howie /.
And I think this is very important because this is an ugly case /.
And even people close to Judith Miller say this is not the one you 'd really like to go to the mat on /.
You 'd love to have a clear whistle blower case /.
You 'd love to have a Pentagon papers case /.
You 'd love to have something where the well - being and the sanctity of the Republic you know hangs in the balance /.
She did n't even report on this /.
But it does point out a very serious issue /.
And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less /.
We 've got to figure this out /.
Well just to clarify uh she did ultimately uh testify about her confidential source /.
The whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of her promise to Scooter Libby offered and why was she able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /.
Well exactly /.
and you know what Howie /. /.
it 's really time for Lucy and other Judy Miller defenders to update her talking points because what Lucy just said just simply does not wash /.
The truth is that as Howie said she did testify /.
The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /.
All of that could have happened /.
It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.
And the New York Times is /.
Lucy /.
/.
Let me get a response from Lucy Dalglish /.
I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.
And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.
They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.
They also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /.
Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /.
You do n't mess with the Feds /.
It 's very clear in her story that she decided finally to testify because she got tired of jail because she was threatened with criminal contempt charges because she wanted to go out and now she 's saying admitting finally write a book /.
All these things are there in black and white /.
and to continue to portray her as a martyr is not going to work /.
And on that point Arianna on that point she says sh- /-
Excuse me /.
Judy Miller says she 's taking some time off from the paper /.
She wants to write a book /.
She would n't share her notes with her colleagues who were writing the story /.
Do you think she 'll ever come back /?
You think she 's saving it for the book /?
Well it 's very clear that she would not be welcome in the newsroom /.
And it 's very clear eh as I reported again that when Bill Keller took her off her WMD beat they were all hoping she would resign /.
Instead she threw a fit /.
but she stayed on /.
This is not a journalism one oh one course the way she handled both the WMD reporting and Plame Gate /.
Frank Sesno please comment /.
Jump in /.
And Howie I 'll tell you what /.
This is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with your correspondants and your reporters /.
You got to know who they 're talking to at some level anyway because you know what /?
It 's about trust with the public /.
and it 's about you know ending up in jail or in court /.
their story says that Bill Keller and Arthur Sulzberger did not press Judy Miller about her conversations with Libby or ask to see her notes while they were defending her /.
Ask to see her /.
And by the way we invited the New York Times to have an editor appear on this program /.
The paper declined /.
