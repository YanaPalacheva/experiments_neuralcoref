Ugly duckling no more
The wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the Malay peninsula .
The Dutch brought it to Taiwan from Java , in the 17th century , and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree .
Old folk in the South remember when wax apples were " just something to munch on " - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to .
But wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown .
For example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin .
The method soon caught on throughout the district .
Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .
This reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit .
The net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit .
As a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year .
The " black pearl " tag did n't originate in Linpien , but it was Linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market .
In 1983 the then - provincial governor Lee Teng - hui visited the town and praised the quality of its black pearl wax apples , so assuring the renown of the fruit .
Subsequently , as president , Lee Teng - hui often gave gifts of black pearl wax apples to foreign dignitaries .
