A dream come true ?
Developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics , biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering , which have emerged as the rising stars of 21st - century industry .
As part of the government 's efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in Taiwan , in July 1999 the Industrial Technology Research Institute -LRB- ITRI -RRB- set up the Biomedical Engineering Center -LRB- BMEC -RRB- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies .
Biochips are one of the core technologies in the field .
BMEC general director Dr. Johnsee Lee says that the ITRI 's four - year R&D program in biochip applications and technology is now in its second year .
Its initial objectives are mainly focused on developing sensor chips to screen for infectious diseases , while later goals will be to develop technologies to test for genetic diseases and cancers .
As well as this new research establishment , in the two years since September 1998 three commercial companies have been set up in Taiwan to make biochips : U - Vision Biotech , Taiwan Genome Sciences and DR. Chip Biotechnology .
Of these , DR. Chip attracted much attention this year when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses , a deadly epidemic of which has gripped Taiwan over the last two years .
