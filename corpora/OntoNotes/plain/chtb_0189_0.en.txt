The Wangma Computer Company was named for the Wubi font , the coding method of Chinese characters invented by the famous computer expert - Yongmin Wang .
This simple , convenient and efficient input method covers more than 85 % of the nation 's computer users , and has become the input technology of Chinese characters which dominates the leading position in our nation .
But , with the rapid development of the computer business , more and more computer users successively come " line up to register " and purchase Wubi 's latest edition and the operating system using the Wangma Chinese characters .
In order to benefit society , the Wangma Computer Company determinedly gave up an opportunity that would have earned big money by dedicating unencoded floppy disks to users , allowing them to copy by themselves .
Leaders , experts and users attending the conference gave a very high appraisal of the decision of the Wangma Computer Company to selflessly contribute .
