Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .
I think many people will say they wo n't .
I would suggest not to lend online .
However , the Internet is after all virtual .
Words sometimes have no emotions .
When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "
Anyhow , I was not able to do that .
I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .
In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .
Our side : A 02 Camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . Annual leave two days .
Their side : One leg of the father -LRB- repaired -RRB- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown .
And most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -LRB- except children -RRB- .
