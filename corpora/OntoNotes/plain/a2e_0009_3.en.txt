Qais the Son of His Father
The Martyr of the Nation , God is his protector and we do not recommend anyone above God , ascended up the gallows walking straight , not with a bowed head , and he was treated to what -LRB- -LRB- the lackeys -RRB- -RRB- witnessed .
He disdained death and was not bothered by it , challenging the provocations of the imperialist donkeys with full self - control , repeating the words " There is no God but God and Mohammed is the messenger of God . "
After the sentence was carried out and his body was dangling in the air , his shoes were above the heads of the scum , the imperialist donkeys , those on whose backs the people of the cross are riding and who share the trenches with them to carry out the most despicable , vile and contemptible crime the Islamic world has know in our current age .

-LRB- -RRB-
Exalted in life and in death **** verily , you are one of the miracles
As if the people around you when they rose up **** delegations at your call in the days of prayer .
As if you are standing amongst them addressing - **** and all of them are standing to pray
You extended your hands towards them in welcome **** just as you extended them towards them with gifts .
When the bowels of the Earth became too tight to - **** confine your exaltedness after Death They made the air your tomb and they exchanged - **** for the shrouds the gown of the sandy winds
For Your Greatness in our souls grows and is tended - **** by guards and trustworthy confidents
May the Compassionate rain his blessings on you - ***** with mercies passing to and fro

My brother Qais , the Son of his Father , I thank you for your post and the addition , may God take care of you .
May your steps in doing good be like someone walking on sand ... he makes no sound but his tracks are obvious .
