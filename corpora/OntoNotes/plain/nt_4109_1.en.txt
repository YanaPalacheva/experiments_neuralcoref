Then Jesus , Peter , James , and John went to the other followers .
They saw many people around them .
The teachers of the law were arguing with the followers .
When the people saw Jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him .
Jesus asked , `` What are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ''
A man answered , `` Teacher , I brought my son to you .
He is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .
The spirit attacks him and throws him on the ground .
He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff .
I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they could not . ''
Jesus answered , `` You people today do n't believe !
How long must I stay with you ?
How long must I be patient with you ?
Bring the boy to me ! ''
So the followers brought the boy to Jesus .
When the evil spirit saw Jesus , it attacked the boy .
The boy fell down and rolled on the ground .
He was foaming at the mouth .
Jesus asked the boy 's father , `` How long has this been happening to him ? ''
The father answered , `` Since he was very young .
The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him .
If you can do anything , please have pity on us and help us . ''
Jesus said to the father , `` Why did you say ' if you can ' ?
All things are possible for the one who believes . ''
Immediately the father shouted , `` I do believe .
Help me to believe more ! ''
Jesus saw that all the people were running there to see what was happening .
So he spoke to the evil spirit .
He said , `` You evil spirit that makes this boy deaf and stops him from talking -- I command you to come out of him and never enter him again ! ''
The evil spirit screamed .
It caused the boy to fall on the ground again , and then it came out .
The boy looked as if he was dead .
Many people said , `` He is dead ! ''
But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .
Then Jesus went into the house .
His followers were alone with him there .
They said , `` Why were n't we able to force that evil spirit out ? ''
Jesus answered , `` That kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ''
Then Jesus and his followers left there and went through Galilee .
Jesus did not want the people to know where they were .
He wanted to teach his followers alone .
He said to them , `` The Son of Man will be handed over to the control of other men , who will kill him .
After three days , he will rise from death . ''
But the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .
