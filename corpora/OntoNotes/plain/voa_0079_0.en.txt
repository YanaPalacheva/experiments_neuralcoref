We are usually not sufficiently clear , we meaning the Secretariat , in explaining that sovereignty and final analysis belongs to the people and sovereignty should be seen in a democratic context .
Sovereignty is not simply a quality of statehood , but it has to do with the power of the people and democratic structures which make sovereignty an important human value .
