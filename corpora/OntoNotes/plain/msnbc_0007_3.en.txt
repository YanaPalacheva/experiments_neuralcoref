Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /?
If you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on September nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /.
But the North Koreans have obligations /.
and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /.
All the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /.
And what we 've seen since then is we 've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim /.
but we see the North Koreans walking away from it /.
So we 've got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the North Koreans to live up to their commitments /.
But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /?
The North Koreans know what 's in the September nineteenth agreement /.
and it 's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /.
But they 've got responsibilities in this agreement /.
and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /.
And what we 've seen Tim especially on July Fourth is the North Koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last September /.
Why do you think the North Koreans chose July Fourth /?
Oh I do n't think it was coincidental /.
You know it 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.
The last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /.
but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /.
Uh but what they 've got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /.
They ca n't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone /.
That does n't work for Japan /.
it does n't work with South Korea /.
and frankly it does n't work with the Chinese /.
So I said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this Chinese delegation going to /.
And Chris Hill our ambassador was in China a few days ago /.
he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister , we want to see China use its influence /.
We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.
Speaker Newt Gingrich the former speaker Republican weighed in on this debate in this way /.
he offered this /.
The time to replace the state department 's failed North Korea strategy of talk forever , act never has come /.
For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /.
For thirteen years the North Korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.
The strategy of talking has failed /.
America 's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /.
It is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /.
But the time for talk is over /.
either they dismantle the missile /.
or we the United States should dismantle it /.
Well uh with all due respect to Speaker Gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /.
And you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /.
And as I said before we are not alone in this endeavor /.
we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /.
I will say this what the North Koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /.
You 've seen very strong statements by the Japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /.
So obviously we 're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia /.
And I think you 'll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /.
Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea 's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n't worked /.
