Ashton Carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between North Korea and the US /?
No I actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the North Koreans if others are at the table /.
Let 's go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /.
The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /.
And we do n't trade with North Korea /.
we do n't recognize North Korea diplomatically /.
uh there 's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea /.
We 're capable of military action /.
and it 's important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /.
But the real levers on Kim Jong - Il are the Chinese and the South Koreans /.
It is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /.
But makes sense to have them at the table /.
The six party talks I totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador Richardson said um in North Korean hands and now missile launches /.
So they 've been running wild for three years or so /.
Um the reason for that /-
there 's a lot of blame to go around /.
you have to start with the North Koreans and their own intransigence /.
The Chinese and the South Koreans have not done everything that they should /.
uh they 've shown the carrots /.
they 've been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wield /.
I think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the North Koreans /.
And our government I believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /.
One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea /.
But there 's another camp uh in this country and I think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the North Koreans is a fools game or is even immoral because of the nature of the regime /.
I do n't agree with that view because I think it 's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea /.
But we have been of two minds /.
and therefore I do n't think we at the table has been as effective as we might have been /.
you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the US government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times /.
Though it 's important that we get our story straight /.
and that 's more important than who else is at the table /.
You had advocated several weeks ago a preemptive military strike on the missile that was about to be tested /.
Many criticize that as belligerent /.
and perhaps could even trigger a North Korea response against South Korea or against Japan /.
who knows /.
In hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /?
Well I do /.
and I want to put that in some context /.
By the way I would say we should have that same position today That is if the North Koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /.
To do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /.
the north Koreans are n't going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /.
And to those that think that 's too much I can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with North Korea /?
At some point we have to draw a line in the sand and defend it /.
We say things are intolerable /.
we say they 're unacceptable /.
and then we tolerate and accept /.
former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and I thought long and hard about this /.
and we thought that this was a relatively nonprovocative way to draw a line in the sand with North Koreans /.
Now I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction also /.
you may say there 's risk in this action /.
but I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction as well letting North Korea go nuclear /.
