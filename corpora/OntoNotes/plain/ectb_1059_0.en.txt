Even if the township of Linpien does n't have a monopoly on the cultivation of " black pearl " wax apples , it was orchards in the Linpien locality that earned black pearls their national renown .
A little town formerly notorious for its ground subsidence problem , Linpien is now turning itself into one of Southern Taiwan 's premier tourist attractions .
The impetus for this change has come chiefly from local historians , along with various voluntary groups .
Just before Christmas break , the rural township of Linpien , on the Pingtung Plain at the mouth of the Linpien river , held its first ever Wax Apple Festival .
The festival , in the town 's riverside park , was held to promote black pearl wax apples and celebrate the local volunteer spirit .
It was a scorching hot day , and heavily perspiring visitors were to be seen wandering among the stalls , lugging bags of wax apples and commenting on their remarkable sweetness .
" There 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , " says local farmer Chen Sheng - tzung .
" How you take care of the orchards , which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit . "
Prices for wax apples range widely , from around 3 pounds for NT$ 100 to NT$ 150 a pound .
Fruit that shows a hint of black through the red color of the skin fetches the best price .
Huang Wan - fu , whose family farms two hectares of orchard with more than 700 wax apple trees , and who has over 30 years ' experience as a fruit grower , says that while other parts of Pingtung County also grow wax apples , " Linpien stands out for its growing techniques , developed through trial and error by the growers themselves , and for vernalization rates of up to 90 % .
