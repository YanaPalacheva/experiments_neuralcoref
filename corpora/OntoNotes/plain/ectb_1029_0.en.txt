The enterovirus detection biochip developed by DR. Chip Biotechnology takes only six hours to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains enterovirus , and if it is the deadly strain Entero 71 .
Worldwide , biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage .
In Taiwan , in recent years the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the National Science Council and the National Health Research Institutes have been strongly pursuing " biochip " research programs .
In the last two years , three biochip companies have also been set up in Taiwan .
Just what are biochips ?
What use are they to mankind ?
Why do so many people have such confidence in their future ?
What is the current state of this field in Taiwan ?
And what are the prospects for future development ?
Let 's take a closer look .
In just a few years ' time , or a few decades , the following scenario could become a reality :
When you 're feeling under the weather , all you need to do is buy a diagnostic biochip from the chemist 's shop , put a drop of urine onto it , and you will find out what is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today .
Everyone will carry with them a biochip bearing a record and analysis of their own DNA .
From it one will not only be able to see one 's own physical condition , but even to predict what diseases one will have in the future .
It will be like an ID card , needed when looking for work , buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage .
Laboratories will no longer need all kinds of large instruments , for all stages of their experiments will be carried out on little biochips , saving time , effort and money .
Today , the scenes outlined above may just seem like pipe dreams .
But these dreams could yet come true , and the key to that happening is those little biochips .
