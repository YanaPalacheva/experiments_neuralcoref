yeah , Good . an older home that you know Julie is of course carving up and making beautiful . %um
uh-huh .
Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to New York ,
and that did n't work out .
She said they had her doing things that she really was n't qualified to do %ah . and that she really did n't feel competent doing .
And , they mutually agreed that she should leave .
And so she was looking for another job .
And , %um , I 'm sure she 'll find one .
She 's so talented .
She may have found one by now . %um
yeah ,

Anyway , he 's enjoying it and liking it
and they 're doing okay .
yeah
he seems to feel really like he 's doing the right thing
and he is Great still in academic publishing .
My other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing
