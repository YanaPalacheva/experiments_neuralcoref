I just got back from the gym .
oh good .
uh-huh .
How 's it going ?
oh pretty well .
It was really crowded today .
yeah .
I kind of assumed everyone would be at the shore .
uh-huh .
I was wrong .
Well it 's the middle of the week or whatever
so .
But it 's the fourth of July .
%mm .
So .
yeah .
People have to work tomorrow .
Do you have to work tomorrow ?
yeah .
Did you have off yesterday ?
Yes .
oh that 's good .
And I was paid too .
oh .
Is it paid today ?
No .
oh .
But %uh
yeah ,
so the gym 's going well .
oh .
But I still need to go more often .
Well how often are you going ?
Only four days a week .
.
yeah .
Got to get that up to five .
%mm .
But , I do n't really like going with Anne Marie because she does n't like to stay very long .
Why ?
I do n't know .
She kind of ,
well unfortunately for some reason she 's not like into cardio vascular .
So when I 'm still riding the bike she 's completely finished her weight lifting routine .
mhm .
And like I have n't even started mine . mhm . You know
and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular . mhm . It 's true . And that lifting the weights wo n't lose weight .
%mm %mm .
You wo n't lose it , you know ,
but
No
I mean you might lose some
but that 's only when yo- .
For a woman who is lifting not that much I do n't think yeah . You would .
I mean yeah
I mean the only thing is %um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time .
yeah ,
So I do n't know
maybe she 'll catch on soon .
You do burn a lot of calories an hour though , lifting weights .
uh-huh .
But %uh
yeah
I mean I do n't think you 're going to lose that much .
and also lifting weights at Bally 's means you 're standing on line for as much time as you 're actually lifting .
Really .
yeah .
That 's too bad .
yeah .
So is it really overcrowded ?
Well , I mean obviously since I work I ca n't get there until about six o'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there .
mhm .
mhm .
But I 'm sure for people who go in the daytime it 's probably dead . yeah . You know
and %um , like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings it 's totally dead .
mhm .
So
But you know the weeknights is pretty crazy .
yeah .
yeah
I found a gym yesterday here that 's only eight pounds a month which is like twelve dollars , twelve fifty
oh yeah .
Wow .
yeah .
It 's at the hospital nearby .
Well that 's a deal .
yeah .
yeah .
So uh-huh . I think %um tonight Charlie and I are going to go over and join up .
Even Charlie 's going to join ?
No ,
but it has to be debited from a bank account so it 's got to be debited from his .
yeah .
In your letter you said that he eats constantly .
oh my god .
Really ?
Alice , I 've never seen anybody eat as much as he does
and he 's so skinny .
mhm .
I mean the amount of cereal he eats like between meals and after meals
yeah .
and we go through a box of cereal every two days .
Really ?
yeah .
Wow .
He eats at least like four of cereal a day like in addition to like meals .
uh-huh
And when he goes to work he brings four sandwiches with him , uh-huh . a bag of potato chips uh-huh . %um you know and then little sweetie things chocolates and **cakies** and stuff like that .
uh-huh
And then you know before he leaves every morning he has like two fried eggs mhm on toast with cheese %um vegetarian sausages %um and like fruit
and oh my god it 's just crazy .
mhm .
It 's crazy how much he eats .
He was probably starving when he was here .
yeah .
I think what we got to do is just when he comes just have lots of cereal .
He likes Cocoa Pops .
oh boy .
Wow .
That 's pretty crazy .
yeah .
It 's all about being a blue collar man .
I guess so .
They 're the ones who can eat all day .
Really ?
Well I mean he does work his ass off
so
yeah .
But %uh 291.01_291.28_B: %hm .
%hm .
So , I assume it 's hard for you not to eat as much as he does .
No .
I learned quick fast in a hurry because I 've gained so much weight .
oh really ?
yeah .
Actually in the first week I was here -- mhm . -- I gained a lot
so .
Well it 's hard to you know not eat when somebody else is eating .
Well I 'm figuring it out fast because -- okay -- with not working out and all yeah . it 's pretty miserable my crunch tape .
%mm .
