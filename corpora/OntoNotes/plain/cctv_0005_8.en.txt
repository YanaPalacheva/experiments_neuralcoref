Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .
Uh-huh .
Right , right .
, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .
Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .
I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .
On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .
Uh-huh .
As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .
