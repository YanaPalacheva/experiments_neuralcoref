The question is , how should the ROC government view Taiwan firms in the mainland ?
And for that matter how is the PRC government looking at the Taiwanese in Dongguan ?
TBAD 's spiritual leader H.D. Yeh often goes to Beijing to represent Taiwan firms in negotiations with the government .
Once , in the presence of many Communist Party cadres , a high - ranking official of the State Council 's Taiwan Affairs Office asked him this question : " You 've gathered so many Taiwan firms in Dongguan and stirred up such enthusiasm among them - but for what purpose ? "
It threw him for a loop .
Yeh is still trying to figure out what the mainland authorities think of TBAD .
For Taiwan firms in Dongguan , investing in mainland China is a road of no return .
" In recent years many Taiwan business people have also tried to invest in Vietnam , only later to close their factories there , " says Chang Han - wen .
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions .
It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore .
Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .
