But %um , guessed what happened .

%um 118.91_120.82_B: Let 's see ,
two weeks ago
I know Sue is going to Rhode Island .
%eh Right .
Right .
Did she see her mom ?
Yes she did .
And ?
Yes she did .
And ?
%um , %um , which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen .
I spoke to her mom on Thursday
%um and I asked her
I said listen
I said %um please come to Shabbat
things have come to a point where I may have to relinquish my , %uh parenting .
%uh would you mind %uh taking her back
and she said no .
She said %uh she 'd be more than happy to .
Really ?
This girl has everything in her dreams you know .
it is as my husband says %uh , %uh al kadir the destiny .
Selema I 'm telling you ,
it is like Allah has just painted the road
and all I had to do was get on it and follow it .
I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me .
I told mom
I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah , only Allah can make the way clear for you .
%uh .
I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother .
Really ?
mhm mhm .
and is she seem like she 's together enough ?
she 's in a two year program .
She 's in the program now .
She 's doing very well .
When I talked to her I 'm talking to her like I 'm talking to you .
I wrote her a letter and told her
I said I feel like I know you even though I never met you .
They seemed surprised that ,
I mean most women you lose your baby that 's it .
But almighty God is
You never even get a chance to see them again .
That 's true .
That 's true .
But that 's what she had wrote me .
she said it is just awesome to her what is happening .
yup .
mhm .
aw I 've heard of that .
yup .
So Francis
Did she say how she felt about what had happened ?
No .
we have n't really talked about that
but I 'm planning on making a trip down to visit her .
Well , how does Akina feel ?
she 's , very happy about it .
Very ha-
Well did she come home and say I saw her , I look like her or what ?
we talked on the phone
and you know she talked about %um her sisters you know and things
we 've spent the night with her sisters and things
and %um it 's just been quite interesting although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive , %um down there and really caused Francis a lot of stress
and %um Francis was very worried about me because she came home two weeks before you know %um because she just was acting like a total nigger child .
uh-oh !
Hope the research did n't hear that !
uh-oh !
