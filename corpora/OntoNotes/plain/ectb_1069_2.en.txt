2. Start over
In China it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . "
But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .
To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .
Hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over .
Chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws .
Stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history .
With each new era , role models change .
Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .
For instance , today 's middle - aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .
They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large .
Many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers .
Their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves .
Then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire .
And there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .
Ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .
