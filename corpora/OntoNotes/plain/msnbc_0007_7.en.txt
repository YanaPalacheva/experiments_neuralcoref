Coming next the view of three former Clinton Administration officials who spent years dealing with the North Korea problem former Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter chief State Department negotiator now at the Georgetown University Robert Gallucci And former US ambassador to the UN now Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson /.
They are all right here next only on Meet The Press /.
And we are back /.
Welcome all /.
Governor Richardson should the United States negotiate directly one on one with North Korea /?
Yes it should /.
Uh our policy so far is not working /.
Uh what you have is North Korea has quadrupled its enriched plutonium since two thousand and two /.
Uh the six party talks are going nowhere /.
We should talk directly to the North Koreans to discuss what is next /.
They need to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.
they need to destroy their missile capability /.
The only way to do that in my judgment is face to face talks at a level of Christopher Hill /.
He is a competent diplomat /.
Uh the successes we 've had with the North Koreans have been through direct engagement When I got some pilots out of North Korea When Bob Gallucci negotiated the agreed framework /.
Secretary Albright close to having an agreement on reducing or terminating their missiles /.
What North Korea is seeing right now is Iran getting a nuclear reactor /.
They see Iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives /.
On the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the United States /.
But also they want to see an effort by the United States to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve /.
I do n't believe they do /.
They are a desolate isolated regime /.
But right now our policy is not working /.
It makes sense to talk directly with North Korea /.
But would n't the world then say oh I see /.
you test a missile on the fourth of July /.
you get the US attention /.
and you bring them to the bargaining table /.
Our policy right now does not work /.
Look where we are right now /.
Uh Asia is destabilized /.
We are trying to outsource our foreign policy to China /.
I believe China is not necessarily interested in helping us on North Korea /.
They do n't want to see a bunch of refugees go into their country /.
I believe that China is a competitor /.
They control a lot of our debt /.
Right now we do not have leverage over China /.
The best effort in my judgment is face to face talks /.
Hard negotiating /.
Get that agreement that was uh signed in September that North Korea has not abided to /.
A time table for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons /.
Efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n't attack North Korea /.
They get economic assistance /.
But our objective should be firm /.
To get them to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.
The best way to do it is face to face talks /.
If the President now changed his course wo n't the headlines be Bush blinks /?
No /.
I believe the headlines would be Bush deals realistically with North Korea /.
He reverses a policy that is not working /.
Ambassador Gallucci do you agree with that /?
Just about entirely /.
uh I have nothing against the idea of the six party talks something Nick pounded on /.
Uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in Asia engaged that 's /-
it 's true /.
it is their problem as well as ours /.
But the fact is it has n't worked /.
And to make the form more important than a substance To care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of plutonium is absurd in my view /.
You 'd have some conditions /.
you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you 'd negotiate face to face /.
Now that they 've launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one /?
This is kind of a rule I think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head /.
And I think a decent interval now and some work at the United Nations is the appropriate thing to do /.
But I think we 're taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now /.
what should the administration do /?
It needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table /.
And the fact that you may get a headline like the President is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of Iran that 's not so bad if you find you 're on the wrong course /.
and we have been /.
