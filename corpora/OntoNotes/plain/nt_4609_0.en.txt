I am a free man .
I am an apostle .
I have seen Jesus our Lord .
You people are an example of my work in the Lord .
Others may not accept me as an apostle , but surely you do .
You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .
Some people want to judge me .
So this is the answer I give them : We have the right to eat and drink , do n't we ?
We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel , do n't we ?
The other apostles and the Lord 's brothers and Peter all do this .
And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?
No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary .
No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself .
No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself .
These are n't just my own thoughts .
God 's law says the same thing .
Yes , it is written in the Law of Moses : ``
When a work animal is being used to separate grain , do n't keep it from eating the grain . ''
When God said this , was he thinking only about work animals ?
No .
He was really talking about us .
Yes , that was written for us .
The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work .
We planted spiritual seed among you , so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life .
Surely that is not asking too much .
Others have this right to get things from you .
So surely we have this right too .
But we do n't use this right .
No , we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ .
Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple .
And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .
It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News .
