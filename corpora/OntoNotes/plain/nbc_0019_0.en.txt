As we heard from David Gregory , one of Governor Bush 's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in Washington , which was exactly what the President was talking about today -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan , saying the version House Republicans passed is unacceptable , because it is unfair , according to the President , to children and seniors .
Instead of meeting us on common ground , instead of working with the White House or congressional Democrats , the Republican leadership closed its doors to compromise -- literally closed the doors to compromise .
They crafted their own partisan tax package and passed it last night on a party - line vote .
Republican leaders for their part said reopening the tax debate is not now realistic and the tax cut bill is probably tombed .
They are angry that the President is threatening to veto it saying it 's wrong to have political budget battles right before the election .
