In paintings , a white cloud layer swirls over Mt. Kuanyin ;
waves on the river drift like a breeze ;
a red sun dances on golden water ;
a yellow moon sings from a deep purple sky . . . .
The Tanshui of illustrations is a place of unblemished beauty , a myth that remains unshakeable .
In the 300 - plus years since its founding , this port town - formerly called Huwei , now Tanshui Township - has seen days of prosperity and has also been through a baptism of fire .
What makes it special among the 309 urban and rural townships of Taiwan ?
How do the people of Tanshui live today ?
How do they recall the past ?
And how do they see the future ?
" You want to know how Tanshui has changed ?
I would say that the biggest change is that the old streets are gone . "
So declares Tu Hsiu - yuan , proprietor of the Hui Yuan Pharmacy , and also director of the Huwei Cultural and Historical Workshop .
His pharmacy is located on what is now called Chungcheng Road , one of the oldest streets , which Tanshui natives still call Huwei Street .
Tu , who has lived his whole life in the old neighborhood , has watched from his doorstep as old shops have refurbished themselves in modern style , and modern shops have adopted the look of the old .
For the convenience of cars , the streets have been widened repeatedly .
In 1988 , the last train on the old Tanshui Line of the railroad chugged into history , taking that old slower pace of life with it .
In 1997 the Tanshui Line of the mass rapid transit system opened , bringing floods of visitors to the town .
Yet , while these tourists bring a human touch to the streets on weekends and holidays , on ordinary weekdays the silence is accompanied only by leftover garbage , empty shops , and those Huwei people who refuse to leave their old homes .
