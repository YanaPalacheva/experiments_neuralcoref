But there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the President on this subject /.
Here 's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea /.
It takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /.
and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /.
It just 's the nature of diplomacy /.
Wish we could solve them overnight /.
And let me go back to January of two thousand two in the President 's axis of evil speech before congress /.
Let 's watch /.
North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens /.
States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /.
By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /.
We 'll be deliberate /.
yet time is not on our side /.
I will not wait on events while dangers gather /.
I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /.
The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons /.
Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.
And yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the President talked about back in two thousand two /.
But he has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.
We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it /.
we 've done a lot to develop missile defense /.
And we 've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /.
So we have been very activist /.
We have followed this policy for a number of years /.
Uh the President is right /.
And as I said before diplomacy ca n't be measured in a snapshot /.
You ca n't just say in a Sunday morning in July that somehow because we have n't come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /.
You 've got to be very purposeful and directed in what you 're trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /.
And that 's what we 're doing /.
We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States /.
But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.
Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong - Il of North Korea /.
I loathe Kim Jong - Il /.
I got a visceral reaction to this guy /.
And then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.
And then this in two thousand two /.
the President called him a pygmy And compared him to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.
Does the President still believe that Kim Jong - Il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.
Kim Jong - Il is a despot /.
And he is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.
Uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /.
They were provocative /.
And so uh we have n't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea /.
No one in our government has /.
We are very clear - eyed about who they are , what they represent , how much they 've denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /.
And we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.
So I think there 's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about North Korea over the last several years /.
And uh we 're determined to press ahead /.
