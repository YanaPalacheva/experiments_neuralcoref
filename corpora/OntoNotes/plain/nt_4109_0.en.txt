Then Jesus said , `` Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom come with power before you die . ''
Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John and went up on a high mountain .
They were all alone there .
While these followers watched him , Jesus was changed .
His clothes became shining white -- whiter than anyone on earth could make them .
Then two men were there talking with Jesus .
They were Elijah and Moses .
Peter said to Jesus , `` Teacher , it is good that we are here .
We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''
Peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid .
Then a cloud came and covered them .
A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son , the one I love .
Obey him ! ''
The followers looked , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them .
As Jesus and the followers were walking back down the mountain , he gave them these instructions : `` Do n't tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain .
Wait until after the Son of Man rises from death .
Then you can tell people what you saw . ''
So the followers waited to say anything about what they saw .
But they discussed among themselves what Jesus meant about rising from death .
They asked him , `` Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ''
Jesus answered , `` They are right to say that Elijah must come first .
Elijah makes all things the way they should be .
But why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will think he is worth nothing ?
I tell you that Elijah has already come .
And people did to him all the bad things they wanted to do .
The Scriptures said this would happen to him . ''
