Permit me to differ .
The Al - Arabiya channel in a short time has pulled the rug out from under the lying al - Jazeera channel .
If the al - Jazeera channel has , as you say , shown a tape about the Shiites then it , in contrast , has not presented more important tapes about the treacherous government of Qatar .
The last of these tapes or news is Peres ' visit to Doha and the warm reception which he and his delegation enjoyed .
There is no channel without faults .
But Al - Arabiya is the best of them and it is more credible than Al - Jazeera whose first aim , as we all know , is to attack Saudi Arabia and to interfere in our country 's affairs , even the private ones .
I wish , even if it was only once , to watch one of those al - Jazeera 's programs in which there is a lot of shouting and fighting , talking about the Al - Udeid Base , or the Israeli trade office and what the Israelis are doing exactly .
There are hidden matters in the state of Qatar and its government .
But Al - Jazeera tries to cover up these failings by attacking other states and governments .

Neither Al - Arabiya nor Al - Jazeera --
How I wish success to the Al - Majd channels , as they are truly the most pure and credible media channels on the face of the Earth .
As for the rest of the channels they serve dubious agendas .
If they hit the spot once they miss a thousand times .

May God grant you long life , my brother Unique , welcome back !
The Al - Arabiya started as a rival to Al - Jazeera but it failed and the reason is famously unknown ... you find it in the word Hebrew
And so the news started and the competition was won with make - up and women 's concerns .
May you stay in good health ..
