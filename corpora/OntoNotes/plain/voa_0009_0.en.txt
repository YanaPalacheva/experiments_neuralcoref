Welcome to another hour of news and information here on the Voice of America .
I 'm Victor Moralis along with David Chadwick on VOA News Now .
India has signed a series of deals with Russia to acquire an aircraft carrier , fighter jets and tanks .
The deals were signed as Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded his talks with Indian leaders in New Delhi .
The two countries also signed a strategic partnership agreement , obligating both countries to avoid joining political or military alliances against each other .
They also agreed to form a joint working group for mutual concerns on terrorism .
News Now 's Susan Yakie spoke with our New Delhi correspondent Jim Teeple about the Russian leader 's visit and his comments about the situation in the disputed Kashmir region .
He said exactly what the Indians wanted to hear , which is that the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan should be solved bilaterally and that there should be no outside interference , as he put it in this question .
Now this is something the Indians have been saying all along .
Of course , Pakistan wants international attention focussed on Kashmir , and Mr. Putin also said that he supports India 's tough approach to the external violence in Kashmir as he described it .
This is another thing that the Indians were glad to hear him say , and he also said that both India and Russia suffer from the same sort of terrorism , as he put it , referring of course to the separatist militancies in Chechnya and Russia and in Jammu and Kashmir .
So on balance I do n't think that the Indians heard anything from Mr. Putin that they did not want to hear .
What sort of hold does Russia have on India and Pakistan ?
Russia has very little influence with Pakistan , but of course Russia supplies India with 70 % of its military hardware and that was of course the second pillar here of Mr. Putin 's visit , which was to finalize some very substantial arms deals .
In fact , we 're hearing that those deals have now been finalized , that Russia will sell India 300 tanks , T - 90 tanks , very advanced tanks , that Russia will also sell to India some Sukoi - 30 bombers , fighter - bombers .
They are going to allow India to assemble about 140 of these bombers here in India , and they are also going to finalize a deal whereby India will acquire the Admiral Gorshkov .
That 's an old Russian aircraft carrier that India has wanted to get for some time because India only has one other aircraft carrier , and this carrier in particular would allow the Indian Navy to extend its strategic strength much farther than it currently can now .
So indeed Russia does have quite a bit of influence here .
These ties have gone way back , nearly 40 years , and they were strengthened considerably by this visit .
In fact both countries have now agreed to combat what they call terrorism with joint groups .
They have also set up a joint working group on Afghanistan , which is of course a cause of concern for both countries .
Mr. Putin 's visit is the first by a Russian leader in seven years .
Why does the trip come now ?
Well , his trip has actually been delayed for a couple of years .
Russian President was supposed to visit India as early as 97 - 1998 , but of course Boris Yeltsin 's health problems got in the way of that , and then of course , Mr. Yeltsin 's abrupt resignation last year another visit and then the subsequent election campaign and inauguration of Vladimir Putin took some time , so it 's been put off for a couple of years .
But there have also been a lot of delays in other areas .
These arms agreements that we were just speaking about have taken quite some time to finalize .
How does this visit by Mr. Putin compare to President Clinton 's visit earlier this year ?
That 's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton had done six months ago , and I think it 's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr. Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing , but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the Indian lawmakers ' hearts .
Of course you will recall when he spoke to the parliament there was an ecstatic welcome for him .
The Indian lawmakers were sort of clambering over each other to shake his hand as he left the parliament building .
There was none of that for Mr. Putin , but he did receive a very warm welcome , although most ordinary Indians who were actually rather captivated by Mr. Clinton 's visit did not really pay much attention to Mr. Putin 's visit .
In fact his visit has somewhat been ignored and in fact the main news story here in India has been sort of a local controversy over the roll - back of fuel prices rather than Mr. Putin 's visit , but he did do what he had to do and he certainly strengthened ties in a strategic sense between Russia and India .
That 's VOA correspondent Jim Teeple .
In a joint statement Wednesday , India and Russia called for further measures against Afghanistan 's dominant Taliban faction .
The statement accuses the Taliban of supporting international terrorism .
