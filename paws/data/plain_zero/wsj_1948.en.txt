Times may be tough on Wall Street for some, but a few bosses are making as much as ever -- or more.
At Bear Stearns Cos., for example, the 15 executive officers led #Cor:PAT by Chairman Alan ``Ace'' Greenberg got a pay increase to $35.9 million for the 14-month period ended #Cor:PAT June 30 from $22.9 million for the 12 months ended #Cor:PAT April 30, 1988.
The figures don't include substantial dividends on holdings of Bear Stearns stock.
Mr. Greenberg himself was paid $4.5 million , before an estimated $1.5 million in dividends, up from $2.4 million the year before.
The increase is noted #Gen:ACT in the brokerage firm's latest proxy statement filed #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Because it operates on a fiscal year, Bear Stearns's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms.
The latest period includes 14 months instead of 12 because Bear Stearns changed #Gen:PAT to a fiscal year #Cor:ACT ending in June instead of April.
Meanwhile, Bear Stearns's 650 stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year, which the company says #Gen:ADDR reflected lower commission revenue #Cor:PAT caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets.
However, Bear Stearns on Monday reported #Gen:ADDR improved earnings for its first quarter, ended #Cor:PAT Sept. 29, partly because of a 31% increase in commissions during the quarter.
William J. Montgoris, chief financial officer, defended #Gen:EFF the lofty salaries at Bear Stearns.
``All of us are on a base salary of $200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes ,'' Mr. Montgoris said #Gen:ADDR .
However, Bear Stearns has never had an unprofitable year since its founding 65 years ago.
Four Bear Stearns executives besides the 62-year-old Mr. Greenberg were paid #Gen:ACT $3 million or more before dividends for the 14 months ended #Cor:ACT in June.
According to the proxy statement, James E. Cayne, 55, Bear Stearns's president, made $3.9 million; an executive vice president, Michael L. Tarnopol, 53, made nearly $3.4 million; and two executive vice presidents, Vincent J. Mattone, 44, and William J. Michaelcheck, 42, made about $3.3 million each.
Mr. Montgoris said #Gen:ADDR the firm has a ``straight mathematical formula'' for determining #Gen:ACT compensation, #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT based on the firm's earnings.
``Just because a particular element of the firm is down,'' such as stockbrokerage, ``doesn't mean the executive committee should be paid #Gen:ACT less,'' he said #Gen:ADDR .
