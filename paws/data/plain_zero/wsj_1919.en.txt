United Merchants&Manufacturers Inc. said #Gen:ADDR its president, Uzi Ruskin, withdrew his proposal to #Cor:ACT acquire control of the New York textile and clothing company.
Last month, Mr. Ruskin proposed #Gen:ADDR, among other things, to #Cor:ACT buy 3.5 million shares, or 38%, for $4 apiece.
Coupled #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT with his current 1.2 million shares and 4% held #Cor:PAT by an associate, the stake would have given him control of 55% of the concern.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Ruskin had said #Gen:ADDR that holders of the other 45% of United Merchants would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares.
A special committee of United Merchants directors said #Gen:ADDR that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations, it couldn't recommend the plan to the full board.
The company is exploring, with a major financial institution, the development of a plan #Gen:ACT to #Cor:ACT boost the value of the company for its holders, Mr. Ruskin said #Gen:ADDR .
In a separate SEC filing, Albert Safer, who holds 6.46% of United Merchants, said #Gen:ADDR he retained investment bank Lazard Freres&Co. for advice as he evaluates the possibility of #Gen:ACT making a bid for the textile maker.
On Friday, Mr. Safer, a Newark, N.J., textile businessman, signed #Gen:ADDR a confidentiality agreement under which United Merchants would provide him with nonpublic information .
