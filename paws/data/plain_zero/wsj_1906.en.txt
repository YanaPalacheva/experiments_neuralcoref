The House Ethics Committee officially cited Rep. Jim Bates -LRB-D., Calif.-RRB- for sexually #PersPron:ACT harassing two female employees, but didn't recommend #Gen:ADDR formal disciplinary action.
Rep. Bates said #Gen:ADDR he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, Dorena Bertussi, denounced the ethics panel's action as ``absurd.''
#Cor:ACT Acting more than a year after Ms. Bertussi filed a complaint, the panel issued a ``letter of #Gen:ACT reproval'' #Cor:ACT saying #Gen:ADDR Rep. Bates had admitted conduct that violated a House rule #Cor:ACT forbidding #Gen:ADDR discrimination against employees on account of their sex.
It ordered Rep. Bates to #Cor:ACT write letters of apology to Ms. Bertussi and to a second complainant, Karen Dryden.
Rep. Bates said #Gen:ADDR he would write the letters as #Gen:ACT ordered #Cor:ADDR #PersPron:PAT .
``I accept the resolution of the matter by the Ethics Committee,'' he said #Gen:ADDR .
The panel also warned Rep. Bates that any further violations ``may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered #Gen:ACT .''
But Ms. Bertussi asked #Gen:ADDR, ``Who in their right mind is going to file another complaint with the Ethics Committee?''
Rep. Bates has publicly begged #Gen:ADDR for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected #PersPron:PAT #Gen:ACT #Gen:EFF with 60% of the vote last November.
