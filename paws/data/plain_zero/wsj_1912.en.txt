South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding, said #Gen:ADDR Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank and the country's chief debt negotiator.
The new agreement will last for 3 1\/2 years starting July 1, 1990, when the current agreement expires .
The announcement coincides with the start of the Commonwealth Ministers Conference in Kuala Lumpur, where proposals for renewed sanctions #Gen:ACT against South Africa, including moves #PersPron:ACT to #Cor:ACT block settling #Gen:ACT of a new debt agreement, were scheduled #Gen:ACT to be #Gen:ACT discussed .
As with the previous pact, the new agreement covers the country's debt ``inside the net,'' which applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector.
The agreement calls for South African debtors to make repayments in eight installments, starting #Gen:PAT #Cor:ACT in December of next year.
The redemption then would be at 1.5% of the total debt, increasing #Cor:ACT to 2.5% in February 1991 , and to 3% at six-month intervals thereafter.
A revised provision would be included #Gen:ACT for the conversion of short-term claims inside the net to long-term loans outside the net.
These claims would be repayable over a 10-year period.
Foreign debt #Cor:ACT falling outside the net of #Gen:ACT affected #Cor:PAT indebtedness -- which Mr. Stahl estimated at $12 billion -- would remain not subject to the debt arrangements.
