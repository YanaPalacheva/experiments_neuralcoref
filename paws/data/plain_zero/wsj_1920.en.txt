The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of #Cor:ACT taking this crisis lightly.
In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
Some of it was necessary to #Cor:ACT get federal help flowing #Cor:ACT to victims, but some seemed designed #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT mostly to #Cor:ACT project an image of a White House in action.
Mr. Bush and his aides were accused #Gen:ACT of responding #Gen:EFF #PersPron:PAT #Cor:ACT too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now.
So the White House announced #Gen:ADDR that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu.
By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.
Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to #Cor:ACT head off criticism.
On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said #Gen:ADDR that he hoped there would be ``less carping'' about the emergency office's performance this time, #Cor:ACT adding that the agency ``took a hit'' for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so.
