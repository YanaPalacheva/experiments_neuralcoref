Coca-Cola Co. may be about to #Cor:ACT intensify the cola wars.
Coke said #Gen:ADDR it will test market #Cor:ACT a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand, Coca-Cola Classic, #Cor:ACT beginning next week in Charlotte, N.C.
Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow #Gen:PAT.
If all goes well, the product will be rolled #Gen:ACT out for national sales sometime next year, a Coke spokesman said #Gen:ADDR .
After the confusion surrounding #Cor:ACT the change of the Coke formula in 1985, Coca-Cola was #Cor:ACT reluctant to #Cor:ACT clutter the Classic name with a brand extension.
But now, the soft-drink giant appears #Cor:ACT willing to #Cor:ACT take the risk.
``The name Classic Coke has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before,'' says #Gen:ADDR Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest.
The Coke spokesman said #Gen:ADDR a caffeine-free Classic should help #Gen:ADDR increase #Cor:ACT volume of the original brand.
Indeed, analysts have said #Gen:ADDR that the absence of new products, among other factors, has limited sales growth throughout the industry.
Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas, according to Beverage Digest.
Coke introduced a caffeine-free sugared cola #Gen:ACT based #Cor:PAT on its original formula in 1983.
It switched to a caffeine-free formula #Cor:ACT using its new Coke in 1985.
Coke has been studying the possibility of #PersPron:ACT introducing a caffeine-free Classic for a year, a company spokesman said #Gen:ADDR .
He said #Gen:ADDR large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now.
