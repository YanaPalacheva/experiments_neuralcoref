In one of the first indoor air-pollution cases to #Cor:ACT go to trial, a state-court jury decided in favor of the defendant, Burlington Industries Inc.
The verdict, #Gen:ACT reached #Cor:PAT late last week in Cincinnati, may end an eight-year legal battle for the Greensboro, N.C., carpet maker.
Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati had sued #Gen:PAT the com - pany in 1981 after #PersPron:ACT installing Burlington carpets in their office.
The Beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick.
As a result of their illness, the Beebes said #PersPron:EFF #Gen:ADDR , they lost $1.8 million in wages and earnings.
In addition, they said #Gen:ADDR that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT substances.
The case had been closely watched #Gen:ACT because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome.
Plaintiffs' lawyers say #Gen:ADDR that buildings become ``sick'' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to #Cor:ACT build up inside .
Anthony J. Iaciofano, a lawyer for Burlington, said #Gen:ADDR the company believes the Beebes' symptoms were not related #Gen:ACT to the carpeting.
He said #Gen:ADDR that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes' symptoms appeared months later.
Catherine Adams, the Beebes' lawyer, said #Gen:ADDR the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing #Cor:ACT such suits.
Scientists are only beginning to #Cor:ACT understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said #Gen:ADDR .
The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used #Gen:ACT #Cor:PAT in the carpeting.
But the Beebes didn't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for #Gen:ACT adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case, Ms. Adams said #Gen:ADDR .
The Beebes have not yet decided whether to #Cor:ACT appeal #Gen:PAT #Gen:ADDR.
TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback.
The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court dismissed six lawsuits #Cor:ACT attempting to #Cor:ACT block a $2.5 billion project #Gen:ACT planned #Cor:PAT for 42nd Street in Manhattan.
Opponents of the project had claimed #Gen:ADDR that the city and the state of New York, which are co-sponsoring the project, had failed to #Cor:ACT adhere to environmental guidelines.
All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed #Gen:ACT since the project's 1984 approval have been dismissed #Gen:ACT before the trial stage.
The two that remain haven't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage.
State officials said #Gen:ADDR the court's ruling clears the way for #Gen:ACT proceedings to #Cor:ACT condemn buildings in the area.
``This project is ready to #Cor:ACT move,'' said #Gen:ADDR State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese.
But developers of four planned office towers cautioned #Gen:ADDR that obstacles still remain.
As part of the agreement with the state, the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- said #Gen:ADDR they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was ``significant litigation'' pending.
Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said #Gen:ADDR the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before #Cor:ACT putting up a $155 million letter of credit to #Cor:ACT cover condemnation costs.
Also, he said #PersPron:EFF #Gen:ADDR , the partnership is waiting to #Cor:ACT see whether the appellate division's ruling will be #Gen:ACT appealed #Gen:ADDR .
The plan, which has been #Gen:ACT plagued with delays and business-related setbacks, seeks to #Cor:ACT transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district.
State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and #Cor:ACT build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel.
FEDERAL JUDGE EXPANDS role of U.S. courts in extradition decisions.
U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, N.Y., ruled that a man #Gen:ACT implicated #Cor:PAT in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986 can be extradited #Gen:ACT to Israel for trial.
A magistrate had initially refused the request, ruling #Cor:ACT that the attack had been a political act for which the man, Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad, would be exempt from extradition .
However, Judge Weinstein wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be #Gen:ACT defined as political acts.
Judge Weinstein also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be #Gen:ACT treated fairly in a foreign court.
To do so, the judge said #PersPron:EFF #Gen:ADDR , the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the State Department's assessment.
He said #Gen:ADDR that in this case he concurred with the State Department's decision that Mr. Ahmad should be extradited #Gen:ACT .
Mr. Ahmad's lawyer said #Gen:ADDR he would appeal #Gen:PAT #Gen:ADDR.
Lawyers close to the case said #Gen:ADDR they believed the ruling was unprecedented.
``Up until now the courts have said #Gen:ADDR it is not their role to supervise #PersPron:ACT the foreign country's courts,'' said #Gen:ADDR Jacques Semmelman, the assistant U.S. attorney on the case.
FORMER CANADIAN AMBASSADOR to the U.S. Allan E. Gotlieb has joined the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Hamilton&Scheetz as a consultant.
Mr. Gotlieb, who serves as a consultant to Stikeman, Elliott, one of Canada's biggest law firms, is advising Pepper Hamilton's Washington office on legal matters related #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT to Canadian-U.S. investment, corporate finance and international transactions.
QUOTABLE:
In a speech prepared #PersPron:ACT #Cor:PAT for delivery in New York yesterday, retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism: ``Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a `shift in direction' on the court ....
I take these pronouncements, like many that have preceded them in past years, with a grain of salt.
In an era of `sound bites' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to #Gen:ACT apply broad labels to a single term.
