The Tennessee Valley Authority issued $4 billion in bonds in the federal utility's first public debt offering in 15 years.
Proceeds from the bonds, with coupon rates in the 8% range, will be used #Gen:ACT to #Cor:ACT replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1%.
The TVA said #Gen:ADDR the refinancing #Gen:PAT #Gen:ACT should save $75 million a year in interest payments.
The refinancing is part of the TVA's strategy of dealing #Cor:ACT with what has been an intractable problem: its staggering $18.5 billion debt, most of which is #Gen:ACT owed to the Treasury Department's Federal Financing Bank.
The TVA currently plans to #Cor:ACT issue a total of $6.7 billion in bonds to refinance #Cor:ACT its high-interest debt.
The $4 billion bond issue also will help the TVA meet #Cor:ACT its goal of not raising #Cor:ACT rates for another year, said #Gen:ADDR William F. Malec, the agency's chief financial officer.
The bond issue is TVA's first public offering since the Financing Bank was created #Gen:ACT in 1974, primarily to #Cor:ACT finance the TVA.
But the offering almost didn't happen.
The TVA, in fact, decided to #Cor:ACT proceed with the bond offering following #Cor:ACT an agreement last week with the Financing Bank, which allows TVA to keep borrowing #Cor:ACT short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market.
The Treasury contended #Gen:ADDR that TVA couldn't borrow #Gen:PAT from both it and the public debt market.
The $4 billion in bonds break down as #PersPron:ACT follows #Gen:PAT: $1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25% and a yield to maturity of 8.33%; $1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375% and a yield to maturity of 8.42%; $2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection, a coupon rate of 8.75% and a yield to maturity of 9.06%.
Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by First Boston Corp. #Cor:PAT and co-managed by Goldman, Sachs&Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley&Co., and Salomon Brothers Inc.
