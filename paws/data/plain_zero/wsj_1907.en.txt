Mesa Airlines said #Gen:ADDR the takeover offer it received #Cor:PAT earlier this week from StatesWest Airlines is for a combination of cash and securities #Cor:PAT valued by StatesWest at $10 a Mesa share.
Both companies are regional carriers in the Southwest.
When it made the offer , StatesWest declined to #Cor:ACT disclose #Gen:ADDR details and asked Mesa to #Cor:ACT do the same.
But Farmington, N.M.-based Mesa said #Gen:ADDR the offer was for $7 in cash and unspecified StatesWest securities #Gen:ACT valued #Cor:PAT at $3 a share.
Based #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT on the number of Mesa shares outstanding not already owned #Cor:PAT by StatesWest, the proposed takeover would have a value of about $15.3 million.
StatesWest owns 7.25% of Mesa.
Last week, Mesa rejected a general proposal from StatesWest that the two carriers combine #Cor:PAT.
In response to the specific offer, Gary Risley, Mesa vice president, said #Gen:ADDR management will ask directors to #Cor:ACT employ a financial consultant to #Cor:ACT advise #Gen:PAT them.
