Egon Krenz, the man tapped #Gen:ACT yesterday to #Cor:ACT become East Germany's new leader, faces the same task that has fallen to #Cor:ACT neighboring #Gen:PAT socialist colleagues: #Gen:ACT reforming a country in crisis.
But unlike the other new leaders in the East Bloc, Mr. Krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation's very existence: German reunification.
Mr. Krenz, age 52, is known #Gen:ACT as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to #Cor:ACT continue the method of running #Gen:ACT a country that the Berlin Wall made famous.
Even if he were to change his stripes #Cor:ACT and become another Milton Friedman, however, he would still stand a good chance of #Cor:ACT losing a country.
Mr. Krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of Erich Honecker, his rigid predecessor as dictator.
Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker: Both spent years overseeing #Cor:ACT the Freie Deutsche Jugend, the youth group that is the communist regime's principal tool for stamping #Cor:ACT young Germans into socialist citizens.
More recently, Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security, and is the youngest member of the ruling #Gen:PAT #Cor:ACT Politburo.
#Cor:ADDR Faced #Gen:ACT with another Mr. Honecker, so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on West German ground.
But if East Germany's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to #Cor:ACT permit Mr. Krenz to #Cor:ACT make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental.
Abandoning #Gen:ACT socialism means #Gen:ACT abandoning the East German state's reason for existence, and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall.
In this scenario it 's hard to #Gen:ACT imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid being pulled #Cor:PAT #Gen:ACT into some kind of tie -- economic, federal or stronger -- with West Germany.
Mr. Krenz may need a bit of time to consolidate #Cor:ACT his empire, which would do a lot to #Cor:ACT promote Reunification Scenario One.
Cartoonists in West Germany have already mocked the exodus by imagining #PersPron:ACT an advertisement placed #Cor:PAT by Mr. Honecker: `` #Gen:ACTWanted #Cor:PAT : one people.''
The West German embassies in Prague, Budapest and Warsaw are continuing to #Cor:ACT find refugees at their gates.
Of course East Germany, true to its tradition, could tighten its borders yet further.
Two of the last gestures of the Honecker regime were to close the border to Czechoslovakia #Gen:ACT and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier.
But with world-wide opinion -- even, apparently in Moscow -- against East Germany, the country would have to #Cor:ACT turn itself into an Albania to #Cor:ACT clamp down further on refugees.
There have been some reports that Mr. Krenz is moving to `` #PersPron:ACTsoften'' his reputation, notably rumors that it was he who kept East Germany's state police off protesters' backs at the country's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month.
But even if he effects a Hyde-to-Jekyll transformation, he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two.
The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder #Cor:PAT alone in the East Bloc.
When Poland moves to #PersPron:ACT reform , it can at least lean on its past: However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic , it was a nonsocialist democracy.
Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country.
Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover #Cor:ACT , should it choose #PersPron:PAT to .
But East Germany is merely ``the land of truly #Cor:ACT existing socialism.''
Beyond that, it has to #Cor:ACT compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity.
Up to now, the main weapon of the ``worker and peasant state'' has been the ideology of socialism.
With talk today of a second economic miracle in West Germany, East Germany no longer can content itself with being #Cor:ACT the economic star in a loser league.
Without Moscow's military and party behind it, East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating #Cor:ACT.
If it goes capitalist, and increases trade with West Germany, it will convert itself, willy-nilly, into an economic annex of the Federal Republic.
There's a certain cruel logic at work here: It 's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced Karl Marx should prove socialism's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls.
There may be forces that would delay this scenario.
Ideologues are the last to surrender #PersPron:ACT, and Germans are an ideological people.
The protesters who greeted Mikhail Gorbachev at East Berlin's airport earlier this month weren't shouting ``Go #PersPron:ACT U.S.A'' -- they were chanting ``Gorby, Help #Gen:PAT #PersPron:ACT Us.''
Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process.
Helmut Kohl's governing #Cor:ACT conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making #Cor:ACT more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone.
But within the government and in the think tanks outside it, many West Germans maintain that they don't want immediate reunification.
Politically, this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring France.
But it would be ironic if Germany's reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin.
In a statement that was as close as East Germany gets to practicing #Cor:ACT ``glasnost'', Otto Reinhold, an East German party theorist, actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma.
``The main problem,'' Mr. Reinhold said #PersPron:EFF #Gen:ADDR in an East German radio interview monitored #Cor:PAT by Radio Free Europe in Munich, stems from the fact that ``the GDR is different'' from other East European states.
``What kind of right #Gen:ACT to #Cor:ACT exist,'' he asked #Gen:ADDR , ``would a capitalist German Democratic Republic have alongside a capitalist Federal Republic?''
That's a question East Germany can't answer #Cor:PAT easily, no matter what its new leader does .
