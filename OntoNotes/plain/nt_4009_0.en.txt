Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .
Some people brought to him a man who was paralyzed and was lying on a mat .
Jesus saw that these people had much faith .
So he said to the paralyzed man , `` Young man , you will be glad to hear this .
Your sins are forgiven . ''
Some of the teachers of the law heard what Jesus said .
They said to themselves , `` What an insult to God for this man to say that ! ''
Jesus knew what they were thinking .
So he said , `` Why are you thinking such evil thoughts ?
The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins .
But how can I prove this to you ?
Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say , ' Your sins are forgiven . '
There 's no proof that it really happened .
But what if I say to the man , ' Stand up and walk ' ?
Then you will be able to see that I really have this power . ''
So Jesus said to the paralyzed man , `` Stand up .
Take your mat and go home . ''
The man stood up and went home .
The people saw this and they were amazed .
They praised God for letting someone have such power .
When Jesus was leaving , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place for collecting taxes .
Jesus said to him , `` Follow me . ''
So he got up and followed Jesus .
