A man came to Jesus and asked , `` Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ''
Jesus answered , `` Why do you ask me about what is good ?
Only God is good .
But if you want to have eternal life , obey the law 's commands . ''
The man asked , `` Which ones ? ''
Jesus answered , `` ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not tell lies about others , you must respect your father and mother , ' and ' love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''
The young man said , `` I have obeyed all these commands .
What else do I need ? ''
Jesus answered , `` If you want to be perfect , then go and sell all that you own .
Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven .
Then come and follow me ! ''
But when the young man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money , he was sad .
He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich .
So he left .
Then Jesus said to his followers , `` The truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom .
Yes , I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom . ''
The followers were amazed to hear this .
They asked , `` Then who can be saved ? ''
Jesus looked at them and said , `` This is something that people can not do .
But God can do anything . ''
Peter said to him , `` We left everything we had and followed you .
So what will we have ? ''
Jesus said to them , `` When the time of the new world comes , the Son of Man will sit on his great and glorious throne .
And I can promise that you who followed me will sit on twelve thrones , and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel .
Everyone who has left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left .
And they will have eternal life .
Many people who are first now will be last in the future .
And many who are last now will be first in the future .
