Now your international readership on the New York Times website has gone down because of this new experiment the Times has where it costs forty nine ninety - five a year for non-subscribers at home to read Times columnists /.
That 's got to be disappointing for you /.
You know um I 'm torn /.
Uh and I 've said this to my bosses /.
Um I want my paper to thrive /.
and if we have a situation where young people grow up in the world that thinks that newspapers are things you read for free online who 's going to pay my travel expenses /?
And at the same time one of the greatest things about New York Times online is I got to reach an audience that just was exponential to what you got in the dead tree edition of the New York Times /.
And because I write about international affairs so I got a lot of young people in India and Egypt and whatnot /.
and for them fifty dollars that may be their tuition for half a year /.
So I 'm honestly torn /.
I really hope this works because I want the New York Times to have a platform that is sustainable /.
But at the same time I hope we can eventually find a way to re-engage those people because definitely we 've lost some of them /.
Eh in the Valerie Plame leak investigation there 's an allegation bouncing around the blogosphere that I just thought I would address with you which is have New York Times columnists somehow been told not to write about this because of Judy Miller 's involvement and being in jail , now being out of jail /.
absolutely not /.
Anybody tell you not to write about it /?
I mean they do n't tell me not to write about anything /.
Howie we are home alone okay /.
I mean I 'm going to China uh on Monday /.
and there 's only one person knows I 'm going /.
and that 's my assistant /.
So um /-
Did you even tell the boss /?
That 's right /. so there 's no edict out there /.
why people have n't written about it I do n't know /.
I 'm focused on other things /.
There 's a lot we do n't know obviously about the Judith Miller situation /.
but why do you think that she has gotten so much criticism /?
After all whether you agree with her or not this is a woman who believed in her convictions and went off to jail for eighty - five days /.
Um you know um Judy 's always been a pioneer and an agent of change you know um and uh has been at the forefront of a lot of stories /.
and people like that in our business um uh engender a lot of attention a lot of criticism and a lot of jealousy /.
Um and uh that 's the only way I can really explain /.
Tom Friedman /.
