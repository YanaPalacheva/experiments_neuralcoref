And joining us now in Los Angeles Arianna Huffington the syndicated columnist and founder of the blog huffington post dot com /.
in Minneapolis Lucy Dalglish executive director of the Reporters ' Committee for Freedom of the Press /.
and here in Washington Frank Sesno professor of public policy and communication at George Mason University and a CNN special correspondant /.
Frank Sesno has the New York Times belatedly to be sure fought and finally made an honest accounting of its role of Judy Miller 's role and the tensions that she created in the newsroom /?
Well an honest accounting /.
yeah maybe /.
but not a full accounting /.
You know and if the whole bottom line of this mess is that the public has the right to know and that that 's what this is all about the public still does n't know a lot of things /.
There 's still a lot of questions here /.
Why was that waiver that Miller was apparently granted by uh Scooter Libby a year ago /-
Why did it wait until she sat in jail for all that time before she actually took up on it /?
you know she 's referred to in the Times ' own account as Miss Run Amuck /.
She was pulled off of certain stories on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction /.
What are her motives and bottom lines to the secrecy of this whole thing /?
There 's a lot we still do n't know /.
Miss Run Amuck was a name she gave herself quite proudly apparently /.
Arianna Huffington the Times piece a lengthy piece acknowledges that Judy Miller was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own WMD reporting was wrong and that while she claims to have pushed for this uh story on Valerie Plame two years ago Jill Abrahamson now the paper 's managing editor says No way /.
That did n't happen /.
In other words there 's a dispute in the accounts /.
Pretty candid stuff for a newspaper to publish about itself would n't you say /?
Well as Frank said there are many unanswered questions /.
And there are many very devastating eh comments and conclusions about Judy Miller as a journalist /.
I do n't think the Times had any choice though Howie . Because remember as a press reporter back on July twenty - seventh the turmoil in the newsroom has been going on for months about Judy Miller and the way the paper has decided to cover the story and the way they decided to present her as a martyr for the first amendment /.
And the main unanswered question here is why did Arthur Sulzberger the newspaper 's publisher allow Judy Miller to hijack the reporting of that story and the editorial policy on that story /.
And the similarities for the Jayson Blair case /.
Remember after the Jayson Blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what happened . Especially about why is a major institution like the Times ignoring so many red flags /.
Alright /.
In the story one of things that we learn is that Bill Keller took Judy Miller off her WMD beat as one of his first personnel decisions when he took eh the reins as editor /.
Alright /.
Well uh I agree there are some unanswered questions /.
but I 'm willing to give the Times a little more credit than you for at least attempting to answer uh many of the questions /.
And Lucy Dalglish here 's the thing that jumped out at me in the story /.
Judy Miller acknowledges that at Louis Libby 's request this is the Dick Cheney aide she agreed to refer to him and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former Hill aide because he had once worked on Capitol Hill /.
Do you have a problem with that sort of thing /?
I thought that was a little bit misleading /.
And I thought it was odd /.
I mean her justification was that well he had been a former Hill staffer /.
Um but that was a strange request /.
and I think the agreement was strange /.
I 'll agree with you on that /.
