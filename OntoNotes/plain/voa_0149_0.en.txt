International aid agencies have warned that proposed United Nations sanctions against Afghanistan 's Taliban authorities could paralyze efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims of drought and conflict .

Among other things , they would also freeze Taliban assets abroad and restrict foreign travel by Taliban officials .
The UN Co-ordinator for Afghanistan said in Geneva , the proposed UN measure could block badly - needed aid shipments .
