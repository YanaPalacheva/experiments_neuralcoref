Frank Sesno the Times was so hamstrung by its passionate embrace of this reporter who after all was facing jail did go to jail /.
One can understand the emotions uh that were unleashed here /.
and yet the editors discouraged stories on the CIA leak investigation and one time killed a piece written by a reporter about Scooter Libby /.
Was that an abdication of journalistic responsibility /?
Maybe yeah maybe /.
I mean what it really shows Howie I think is just how difficult it is for news organizations to report on themselves /.
You know news organizations demand total transparency whether you 're General Motors or United States government /.
We want access /.
We want explanation /.
We want full disclosure /.
But it 's very difficult for them to do it themselves /.
In this case and the Times makes it very plain in their story today they really suffered /.
They were behind on virtually every major aspect of the story /.
Even when she went to jail /?
Even when she went to jail and w- /.
When she won release from jail /.
Yeah at the point that she came out /.
They did n't say that you know until she walked out /.
And the question and this is a very serious question it 's not answered in the article /.
Were editorial higher - ups and were the corporate lawyers at the New York Times in some way leaning on suppressing and distorting the coverage from the news uh section /?
Arianna Huffington uh in this lengthy piece this morning uh uh Judy Miller is quoted excuse me as saying that there was another source beside Scooter Libby that she dealt with on the Valerie Plame situation /.
She does n't recall who that source was looking at her notes and seeing the uh notation Valerie Flame /.
She got the name wrong /.
Do you buy this notion that she does n't recall who this other source was /?
No of course not Howie /.
In fact I think this is the major unanswered question /.
We do n't know who eh her source was when it comes to revealing the identity of Valerie Plame /.
And to say that she does not recall is really as convincing as having Woodward and Bernstein saying that they do not recall who Deep Throat was /.
After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /.
You know I do n't /-
