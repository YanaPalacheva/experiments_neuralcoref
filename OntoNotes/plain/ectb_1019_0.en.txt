-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Thomas Lu is the doyen of the Chinese news media .
Still out on the journalistic front lines at 81 , this spry , forthright veteran has an immense zest for life .
At 78 , drawing on his astonishingly sharp memory , he completed his reminiscences and " record of emotional regrets . "
He is not only one of the " wonders " of Taiwan 's journalistic world , but is also recognized by those of his generation as a gentleman and a " good - looking man . "
A person 's looks change with their age and their state of mind .
Many friends have told me I look better the older I get .
People do n't know that when I was young I had dreadful protruding teeth , but now not only do my teeth no longer show , but the lines of my face have also softened .
