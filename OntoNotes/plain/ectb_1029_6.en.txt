Pushing the envelope
Although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives .
But one day they will play an important role in all our lives .
" Applications and commercialization are our goal , " says Johnsee Lee .
He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .
Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .
Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .
He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .
IBMS associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .
But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .
Mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun .
