Ambassador Gallucci you negotiated that ninety four agreement /.
The North Koreans stopped processing in one plant if you will /.
but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /.
Not actually /.
No that 's not what we found out /.
What happened was we did do a deal /.
We did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /.
We made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /.
And the deal would have had the North Koreans end their nuclear weapons program /.
We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan /.
We do n't know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /.
We think over a period of time they 'll do what the Pakistanis did , what the Iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /.
But they never got there yet /.
Or we do n't think they 've gotten there yet /.
But they broke their word /.
They absolutely cheated /.
There 's no question about that /.
But really you ought to be clear here what 's happened /.
There was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /.
Plutonium production was stopped /.
Right /.
And afterwards tragically I believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /.
And we find ourselves now with the North Koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.
And freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /.
And they say they 've used it to make bombs /.
we 'd have to estimate about five more /.
And with each passing day I would argue to you more important than that missile that Ash would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we 're going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to Al - Queda Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.
We can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.
We know the return address /.
We do /.
But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.
And deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than his life /.
So no defense no deterrents /.
we need to lock up the nuclear program /.
You would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /.
But you can have all the agreements you want /.
if they 're going to cheat what good are they /?
Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in my view /.
You make a deal /.
Nobody did that deal in ninety four thinking we were trusting North Koreans /.
We had some transparency a measure of it /.
and you verify /.
We caught them cheating /.
You might make another deal /.
I think you should /.
You ask the question you make another deal are you better off with the deal /.
or are you better off without it /?
If the answer to the former is yes you do the deal /.
You do n't +ask I think the simple question have they fooled us before /.
then do n't let them fool us again /.
I do n't believe that 's the way you proceed in international affairs /.
It asks a very tough question about the national security /.
should we do this /?
Is it better for us /?
Ask for more transparency /.
Insist on it /.
Be tough in the negotiations Not in the formality of whether it 's six parties or it 's bilateral /.
