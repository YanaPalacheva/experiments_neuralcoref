Moving on to the Laci Peterson case Bill , an unusual request from Scott Peterson 's attorney .
A pair of Laci Peterson 's missing shoes could be very important evidence in Scott 's murder trial .
She is asking anyone who finds the pair to give them back .
No sign of Geragos or Peterson in court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to unseal warrants obtained before Scott Peterson 's arrest .

Joining us , Beth Caras .
