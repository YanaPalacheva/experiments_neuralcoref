Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped .
The soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head .
Then they put a purple robe around him .
They kept coming up to him and saying , `` Hail to the king of the Jews ! ''
And they hit him in the face .
Again Pilate came out and said to the Jewish leaders , `` Look !
I am bringing Jesus out to you .
I want you to know that I find nothing I can charge him with . ''
Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe .
Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is the man ! ''
When the leading priests and the Jewish guards saw Jesus they shouted , `` Kill him on a cross !
Kill him on a cross ! ''
But Pilate answered , `` You take him and nail him to a cross yourselves .
I find nothing I can charge him with . ''
The Jewish leaders answered , `` We have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the Son of God . ''
When Pilate heard this , he was more afraid .
So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , `` Where are you from ? ''
But Jesus did not answer him .
Pilate said , `` You refuse to speak to me ?
Remember , I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ''
Jesus answered , `` The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God .
So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . ''
After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go free .
But the Jewish leaders shouted , `` Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar .
So if you let this man go free , that means you are not Caesar 's friend . ''
When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out to the place called `` The Stone Pavement . ''
-LRB- In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha . -RRB-
Pilate sat down on the judge 's seat there .
It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week .
Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is your king ! ''
They shouted , `` Take him away !
Take him away !
Kill him on a cross ! ''
Pilate asked them , `` Do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? ''
The leading priests answered , `` The only king we have is Caesar ! ''
So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .
The soldiers took Jesus .
He carried his own cross to a place called `` The Place of the Skull . ''
-LRB- In Aramaic the name of this place is `` Golgotha . '' -RRB-
There they nailed Jesus to the cross .
They also nailed two other men to crosses .
They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle .
Pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross .
The sign said , `` jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ''
The sign was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek .
Many of the Jews read this sign , because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city .
The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate , `` Do n't write , ' The King of the Jews . '
But write , ' This man said , I am the King of the Jews . ' ''
Pilate answered , `` I will not change what I have written . ''
After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts .
Each soldier got one part .
They also took his tunic .
It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom .
So the soldiers said to each other , `` We should not tear this into parts .
Let 's throw lots to see who will get it . ''
This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say : `` They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for what I was wearing . ''
So the soldiers did this .
