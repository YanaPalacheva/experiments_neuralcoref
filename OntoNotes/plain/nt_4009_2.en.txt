The news about this spread all around the area .
As Jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him .
They said loudly , `` Show kindness to us , Son of David . ''
Jesus went inside , and the blind men went with him .
He asked them , `` Do you believe that I am able to make you see again ? ''
They answered , `` Yes , Lord , we believe . ''
Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , `` You believe that I can make you see again , so it will happen . ''
Then the men were able to see .
Jesus gave them a strong warning .
He said , `` Do n't tell anyone about this . ''
But they left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area .
As these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to Jesus .
This man could not talk because he had a demon inside him .
Jesus forced the demon out , and the man was able to talk .
The people were amazed and said , `` We have never seen anything like this in Israel . ''
But the Pharisees said , `` The ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ''
Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages .
He taught in their synagogues and told people the Good News about God 's kingdom .
He healed all kinds of diseases and sicknesses .
Jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless -- like sheep without a shepherd to lead them .
Jesus said to his followers , `` There is such a big harvest of people to bring in .
But there are only a few workers to help harvest them .
God owns the harvest .
Ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest . ''
