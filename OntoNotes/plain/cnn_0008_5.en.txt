When we come back media speculation run amuck over possible indictments at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania and the President 's scripted session with troops in Iraq /.
Stay with us /.
Welcome back to Reliable Sources /.
As the CIA leak investigation continued this week media folks did plenty of speculating with no evidence about the possible indictment of a certain top White House official who testified before the grand jury for the fourth time on Friday /.
Karl Rove his closest aide the number two man in the White House the man that has been called Bush 's brain /.
If he 's indicted and has to go it undermines the key source of this President 's public support his character /.
If Rove gets indicted that could bring down the Bush administration I think /.
My understanding from talking to somebody quite close to this investigation is that they think there are going to be indictments /.
and possibly Karl Rove could be among them /.
Lucy Dalglish if Karl Rove is indicted , if Karl Rove is indicted , what if he 's not indicted /?
Is n't this the worst kind of journalistic speculation /?
Yeah /.
You know I think it 's always dangerous to speculate whether or not you 're really besmirching someone 's reputation . Although I 'm not sure you can do that with Karl Rove /.
But it uh is very very you know eh irre- /-
I would prefer that people keep an eye on you know watching him testify and going in and out of the courthouse /.
But uh will it bring down the administration /?
I do n't know /.
Ah eh I do n't know /.
Well nobody knows /.
That 's the point /.
Arianna Huffington I used to cover the justice department /.
Not everybody who 's under investigation winds up getting indicted /.
Ah but you certainly and you 're uh on a blog so maybe it 's a different standard have speculated about Rove 's fate as well /.
Well not just Rove though /.
what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney 's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies /.
I mean that is really the web /.
But it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the Miller story , that uh Fitzgerald is after Cheney even in some of the questioning eh of Miller /.
I think those were fairly routine questions about /.
you have Judy Miller there /.
you ask about Cheney /. /.
He was being thorough /.
I think we 're overthinking this whole thing /.
Karl Rove and this speculation business you know /.
Frank Sesno /.
Pat Fitzgerald /.
It 's very easy to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /.
It 's irresponsible journalism /.
It 's really how you speculate not that you speculate /.
The fact of the matter is that Karl Rove has been to the grand jury four times /.
The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they 're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /.
It would be irresponsible I think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town /.
And there are plenty of Republicans mostly Republicans who are worried about this /.
Alright I want to turn now to uh President Bush 's uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with US troops in Iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be /.
Let 's take a look at the actual footage /.
And in your interactions with the Iraqi civilians in Tikrit Saddam 's hometown how are they reacting to this political process /?
Sir in the north central area of Iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent /.
Can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in Tikrit /?
Sir in north central Iraq voter regis- /-
Are you stunned /?
Are you stunned /?
Shocked /.
I ca n't believe it /.
they rehearsed it /.
They rehearsed it /.
They rehearsed it /.
Yeah you know something /?
uh I remember a long time ago Michael Deaver the ultimate image meister for Ronald Reagan said my job is to light the President well and for everything I do to put the President in a good light /.
Now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see /.
and what the problem this now creates for the White House is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the President has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of Iraq the whole bit /.
But the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote /.
I mean anybody in television will tell you that 's complicated business /.
You have satellite delay /.
You have a half a dozen people sitting there /.
Who 's going to speak when /.
You do n't want awkward silences /.
You 're going to walk through it /.
so that it happened does n't surprise me /.
That it hurts the President yeah that 's inevitable too /.
Arianna Huffington does the staging here surprise you at all /?
Well it 's not the question of surpising me Howie /.
It 's the fact that we are talking about war /.
This is not just any photo opportunity /.
Of course that 's part and parcel of the presidency /.
But we 're talking about a war in which almost two thousand young Americans have died /.
And we are also using soldiers as props /.
Yes it is shocking /.
and I think Keith Olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on MSNBC /.
Alright /.
And I think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing /.
And we 'll have to leave it there /.
Last word /.
Arianna Huffington Lucy Dalglish in Minneapolis Frank Sesno thanks so very much for joining us /.
