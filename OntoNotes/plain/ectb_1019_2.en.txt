Looks are something you are born with , but character is something you can work on , and it can outweigh your appearance .
Luo Jialun , one of the leading lights of the May Fourth Movement , is a famous example .
Luo was not good looking , and was even ridiculed as " looking like a cross between a pig , a dog and a bear . "
But he was tremendously well - read , had a beautiful writing style , and for a time he was Chinese ambassador to India .
His wife was a universally admired beauty , the envy of all .
So I say , " handsome is as handsome does . "
I was imprisoned by both the Kuomintang and the Communists , and at times I might have been killed .
Perhaps other people in the same situation might have wallowed in self - pity , but I saw it as a rare opportunity in life .
In 1951 , in a dark prison cell during a big Communist purge , what came into my mind was not fear of death .
Instead , I wondered what kind of headline my death would merit in the newspapers .
" 10,000 Rush to See Lu Executed " ?
Perhaps it was this eternal optimism which changed my frame of mind and my appearance .
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people :
it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look .
But do n't overdo it .
It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .
