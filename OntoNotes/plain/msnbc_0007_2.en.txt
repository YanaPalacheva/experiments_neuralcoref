But first North Korea /.
on the fourth of July North Korea tested medium and long range +missiles /.
and their nuclear program appears to be full speed ahead /.
What is the Bush administration going to do about it /?
Here with us the Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns /.
Mr. Ambassador good morning /.
Thank you Tim /.
good morning /.
Will the United States insist that the United Nations impose sanctions against North Korea /?
Well we are pursuing a very aggressive resolution up in New York at the Security Council /.
and we think we 've got the votes to pass that /.
But we 're also operating on multiple diplomatic fronts /.
We have our lead negotiator Chris Hill Ambassador Hill in Beijing Seoul and Tokyo this week /.
President Bush and Secretary Rice have been working the phones with uh their counterparts /.
And we 've also had a very interesting development today /.
the Chinese Government is sending tonight to a senior delegation /.
And you know frankly we think it 's time for China to use its influence with North Korea /.
The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /.
China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward , to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they 've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /.
But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea /.
Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution /?
If you look at this UN resolution that 's under debate in New York it does /.
it 's a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /.
It says that what the North Koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /.
It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea /.
That strikes us as an obvious point /.
And I think what we have to do we 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.
we 'll have to see how the Chinese and Russians react to this /.
but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia 's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.
That 's certainly the best policy for the United States /.
Force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.
there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea /.
Here 's one Nicholas Burns on National Public Radio /.
With Iran the United States has made an offer /.
and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran /.
Why not sit down in the same way with North Koreans Say to them stop developing your program /.
and we 'll sit down with you one on one /.
Well Tim we 're trying to sit down with the North Koreans in the context of the six party talks /.
We 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks /.
but we really do n't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea /.
The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States /.
It should have the same interest /.
And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program /.
Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests /.
and the Russians do as well /.
And so we think we 're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries /.
I simply do n't see why it 's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly /.
So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea /.
We 're perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /.
and in that sense it 's analogous to what we 're trying to do with Iran /.
Secretary Rice announced about a month ago that should the Iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we 'd be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /.
and that 's with the Europeans and Russians and Chinese /.
So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States /.
What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries /.
And the Asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /.
Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea /?
Well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.
it 's a major human rights violator /.
There 's massive famine /.
And certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /.
Uh what we 've got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /.
And that problem is nuclear weapons /.
The problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /.
I think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative , they were reckless , they were also unsuccessful /.
They fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /.
They tried to fire the longer range missile the /.
and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /.
It crashed in the sea of Japan /.
So we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the North Koreans /.
and that 's what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /.
