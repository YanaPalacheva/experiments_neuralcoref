And we 're back /.
Two presidential birthdays this week /.
President Bush turned sixty last Thursday /.
And this Friday former president Gerald Ford will be ninety three years old /.
Our thirty - eighth president talked about age health and the presidency right here thirty one years ago /.
Mr. President in the early days of the republic the American people took great chances on young men in the presidency /.
Now here we are looking at seventy six /.
and most of the leading candidates are old geezers like me in their sixties /.
Now we seem to have misplaced a generation here somewhere /.
is the system out of phase /.
what explains this /?
I think age is a state of mind and obviously a state of health /.
I 'm in the early sixties /.
I feel as vigorous mentally and physically as I ever have at any time in my life /.
I do n't think you should rule a person out just because they 're my particular age /.
The other hand I do n't think uh you should rule out a younger person who by experience or intelligence or overall capability is a potential candidate /.
I do n't think you should categorize people just by age bracket /.
I believe you ought to look at the person how strong he is mentally and physically what is his experience and what his background is /.
that 's the criteria I would use /.
happy birthday President Gerry Ford /.
And also happy birthday to another American legend /.
thirty eight years ago founded the special Olympics /.
She turns eighty five tomorrow /.
And we 'll be right back /.
