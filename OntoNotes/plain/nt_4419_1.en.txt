The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , men from Macedonia who were traveling with Paul , and rushed all together into the stadium .
Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the Lord 's followers did not let him go .
Also , some leaders of the country who were friends of Paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium .
Some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else .
The meeting was very confused .
Most of the people did not know why they had come there .
Some Jews made a man named Alexander stand before the crowd , and they told him what to say .
Alexander waved his hand , trying to explain things to the people .
But when the people saw that Alexander was a Jew , they all began shouting the same thing .
For two hours they continued shouting , `` Great is Artemis of Ephesus !
Great is Artemis of Ephesus !
Great is Artemis . . . ! ''
Then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet .
He said , `` Men of Ephesus , everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis .
Everyone knows that we also keep her holy rock .
No one can deny this , so you should be quiet .
You must stop and think before you do anything else .
`` You brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess .
They have not stolen anything from her temple .
We have courts of law and there are judges .
Do Demetrius and those men who work with him have a charge against anyone ?
They should go to the courts .
Let them argue with each other there .
`` Is there something else you want to talk about ?
Then come to the regular town meeting of the people .
It can be decided there .
I say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting .
We could not explain all this trouble , because there is no real reason for this meeting . ''
After the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home .
