RUSSIAN officials say Cuba has no interest in completing construction of a Soviet era nuclear power plant on the island .
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday , Moscow has no plans to press Havana to finish construction of the Juragua nuclear facility .
He made his comments on the last day of his official visit to the Communist ruled island .
Construction halted on the Juragua plant in 1992 , following the collapse of the Soviet Union , which provided funding and technology for the project .
Friday 's announcement coincided with the permanent closing of the Chernobyl nuclear facility , which was the scene of the world 's worst nuclear accident in 1986 .
