How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?
Here are a few suggestions :
1. Live well at every stage of life
Li Liang - che , a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .
He points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .
Smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier .
In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life .
Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .
Is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?
Chang Der - chung , an associate professor in the Department of Living Science at National Open University who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start .
Middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they 're not hard to avoid .
Are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?
Then no matter how busy you are , you 've got to set aside some time to be with your spouse .
Are you worried about losing your job ?
Then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money .
Are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?
Then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves .
There are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start .
Otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed .
