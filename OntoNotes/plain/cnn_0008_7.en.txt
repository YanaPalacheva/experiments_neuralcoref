On that point let me read a statement from a Sixty Minutes spokesman /.
And this involves uh their saying that they contacted Clinton 's office back in August with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the President 's people said he did not want to be interviewed /.
They gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until Lanny Davis launched his PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack Freeh rather than deal with his allegations /.
Denials from President Clinton and Sandy Berger that did deal with Freeh 's allegations were included in the Sixty Minutes report /.
Well first of all it 's false to say that I was asking to disparage Freeh /.
I was asking to talk about facts that Freeh was saying that were not true /.
You do n't mind disparaging Freeh /.
my observation /.
no in fact I disparage any man who as FBI director has a personal pique rather than doing his job /.
That 's disparaging /.
Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.
When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.
They never talked to Mister Freeh /.
and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.
So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.
When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton 's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.
When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.
And even since that interview Mister Freeh has backed off and has not told people who his source is /.
and he has n't even insisted that it was true /.
He just said somebody told him it was true /.
Hold on /.
Sixty Minutes spokesman Kevin Tedesco said in the statement I just referred to that the Clinton office was contacted in August with a detailed list of charges /.
That 's false /.
Are you saying that 's false /?
They were never told /. /.
or at least I 'm now basing this on what Mister Carson has told me /.
Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.
Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.
President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.
so what Mister Freeh said was false /.
That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.
Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.
He criticized people /.
He criticized Ken Starr /.
They did n't have Ken Starr on to rebut /.
Now the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation uh who ca n't stand Clinton clearly writes a book gets one segment for his book /.
and you cry foul /.
Nobody was complaining about when Bill Clinton was getting all this airtime on CBS /.
Look /.
Look this is a program about good journalism /.
Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.
Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.
or should you do reporting /?
Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.
Let 's see whether it 's true and start making phone calls /.
They did not do that /.
That 's a fact /.
Alright Lanny Davis thanks very much for coming on to Talk Back to the Media this morning /.
We appreciate it /.
