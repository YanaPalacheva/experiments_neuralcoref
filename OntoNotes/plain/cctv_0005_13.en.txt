Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .
Yes .
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .
It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .
Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .
It was not clear , it was very congested .
You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
You could find out other news only by telephone .
The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .
Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .
Yes .
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
