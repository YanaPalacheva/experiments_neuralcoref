As the politicians argued , Formosa Plastics boss Wang Yung - ching convened a meeting with other captains of industry to come up with some advice for the government on economic policy .
For the first time Wang voiced support for Lee Yuan - tseh 's proposal that " with ' one China ' as the precondition , each side can have its own interpretation . "
Wang also agreed with Lee 's notion that time is running out for Taiwan , in the belief that Taiwan will only have time on its side once it starts to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland .
Consensus on the " one China question " is an urgent priority for both sides if there is to be a peaceful future .
Wang Yung - ching 's demand for a review of the government 's " go slow " policy , and opening of the three direct links , brought a personal phone call from the president , who invited him to come and discuss policy .
On November 25 Wang and a handful of other leading industrialists went to call on the president at his official residence .
The businessmen said that shelving the " one China " issue was not the right thing for the government to do , and that Taiwan could no longer afford to play word games .
They stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue , and said that the government should also think about moving towards political dialogue .
