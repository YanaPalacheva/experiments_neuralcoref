Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement .
Is my opinion above correct ?
I believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned " father " system and " son " system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill .
For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the " father " system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the " son " system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .
So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal .
It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal " human relations " and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .
Yes , this is the case .
My opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : None of the current " advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie " has established and proposed a new deal " against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . "
All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal , " all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % " vested interests , " and their development logic asks the " 95 % " laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government it is .
