So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?
Things are going very well .
I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .
oh .
And that %um
No , you had n't mentioned that .
%eh , oh , okay .
okay , so %um
%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,
and you were entertaining offers .
And , %uh
well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .
%um oh . So things are going extremely well .
So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .
You know , he , %uh ,
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then
so I decided that it would make sense to do this .
%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .
%mm .
So I 'm quite pleased .
Well that 's good .
%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .
I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .
But , %uh , it should come out this year .
oh , well that 's good .
It should be done in a few months .
oh , yeah
I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .
yeah ,
yeah .
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?
%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .
%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .
But %ah well . I am working on that one .
%uh .
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .
oh , harsh . Harsh .
yeah .
yeah ,
and .
Not a whole lot I can do about that now .
Indeed . Indeed .
have to deal with the situation .
And
So that 's what I 'm doing .
Sounds good .
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .
I 've actually been doing a lot of it .
oh wow .
