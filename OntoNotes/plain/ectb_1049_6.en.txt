Tanshui Facts and Figures
Tanshui Township -LRB- also spelled Tamsui -RRB- is part of Taipei County .
It abuts Sanchih Rural Township to the northeast , the Kuantu area of Taipei City to the southeast , and the Taiwan Strait to the northwest ; to the southwest it faces Pali Rural Township over the Tanshui River .
It covers an area of just over 70 square kilometers , and has a population of 115,000 .
It is the largest paddy - rice producing area in Taipei County .
In days gone by , because the Kuroshio current passes close by , the waters offshore were rich fishing grounds .
However , in recent years , pollution from the Tanshui River and exhaustion of fish stocks have caused the catch to dwindle .
Among the more famous tourist sites are Fort San Domingo , Yin Shan Temple , the Lixuetang school -LRB- known in English as Oxford College , founded in 1882 to train missionaries -RRB- , Huwei cannon emplacement , the mangrove conservation area , Shalun beach recreation area , the historic buildings of the Mackay Hospital and Tamkang Middle School , " Antiques Street " -LRB- Chungcheng Road -RRB- , and the ferry pier .
Public transportation includes inter-city bus service , the Tanshui Line of the Taipei mass rapid transit system , and local buses .
