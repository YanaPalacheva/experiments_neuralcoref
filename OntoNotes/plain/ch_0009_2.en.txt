Before I forget , I saw George Silinas a couple of days ago .
oh . How 's he doing ?
And he 's had
Well he 's working for an American firm over here ,
and he 's doing very very well . %um ,
and his wife just had their fourth child .
Wow .
A little boy . Benjamin .
yeah .
Wow .
%um , about , %uh , two weeks ago maybe .
%huh .
Tops .
And I got a card from ,
you remember Amy Gleason ?
yeah .
yeah .
Well she just had a baby a couple of
heard that .
Well this is number two .
okay .
I just got a card from Ron and Doris ,
oh .
and they see Amy Gleason on occasion .
And so I think they told me that .
yeah .
Have you heard from Ron and Doris ?
Not in a while , no .
They are now living in Rhode Island .
You probably knew that .
Well . yeah .
And she 's teaching at U R I .
yeah .
And it was a very nice letter , because it sounded like she went through very similar things that I did .
You know , I went from Chicago to U C S G to here .
Right .
And it 's just such an intellectual letdown .
Right .
And she went from Penn , %um To Columbia . to Columbia to U R I .
Well Columbia 's okay .
yeah .
And she said the students are just ,
you know , they do n't care ,
and they 're not very good ,
and all of a sudden she 's getting conference papers rejected
and she thinks it 's the affiliation .
yeah .
Because she does n't think the quality of her work has changed .
Now I have n't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri %um , you know , affiliation yet .
Because the last one I submitted , %um , was in the fall ,
and I still had my San Diego affiliation .
yeah .
%um , in fact I 'm still officially on leave .
If anything came up in the next year we could still go back . uh-huh . %uh you know , for Sam .
Wow .
But I think it 's very very very very yeah . unlikely .
yeah .
But at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now , she %um has come to terms with this ,
and yeah . she 's accepted that there 's a lot of good things in Rhode Island .
And , %um , you know , their life is a lot less complicated ,
and she has more time to be a parent .
yeah .
Good .
And she 's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about .
Ron is working as a financial consultant for , %um , Meryl Lynch .
And he
oh .
yeah , he had been doing work for some environmental firm , as a consultant .
uh-huh .
And , it did n't work out .
%um He was changing projects every couple of weeks
and he said he could n't keep on top of it .
He could n't learn the whole new area %mm . that fast each time .
%mm .
%um , and he says he went in and had some tests ,
and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder .
Which you know , given how far he 's gotten , you know , he got his degree at Tufts and all , I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they 're diagnosing this . %um
%mm . I wonder about it .
But anyway .
yeah ,
but that 's what he said .
And %um
yeah .
He %um
Whatever 's helpful .
Right .
So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that .
Good .
