Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .
Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges .
A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .
Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest .
As a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked .
Middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook .
In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy .
Even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases .
Social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems .
This is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings .
But by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health .
In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .
