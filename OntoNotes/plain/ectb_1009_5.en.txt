In enemy territory
As soon as you 're through customs at Hong Kong , you see them : women draped with beauty pageant - like sashes with the Chinese characters for " Global Travel " emblazoned across them .
Pushing small luggage carts , they lead customers to the buses .
They have become a " must - see " tourist sight for Taiwanese visitors to Dongguan .
" At first we thought of talking with Hong Kong airport about renting a counter , " explains Chang .
" But for just one - fourth of a six square - meter booth , the rent comes to HK$ 200,000 . "
So the company thought that instead of spending that much money on a booth it made more sense to lower operating costs and pass these along in the form of lower fares for its customers .
They never expected that the luggage carts would in fact make it much easier for customers to find them in sprawling Hong Kong airport and would become an easily recognizable company trademark .
" Now mainland Chinese travel agencies have started copying the way we use the carts , " says Chang , laughing .
Since Global buses started plying this route in November 1988 , daily bus departures have risen from 4 to 27 , with over 20,000 riders a month .
Global plans to introduce new services , including car rentals and plane ticket reservations and confirmations .
