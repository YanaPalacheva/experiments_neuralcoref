and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.
There 's a lot of good things going on in Iraq /.
There 's a lot of progress being made we 're not seeing reported by the press /.
Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?
No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.
I wish I could say /.
I wish I could be so sure /.
but General Casey does n't have a bird 's eye view /.
And that 's why we get surprises in Iraq /.
Uh that 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /.
and maybe you know we 're going to see more surpises in the coming future there /.
But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.
And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-
I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.
So I 've been there five times /.
but it 's episodic /.
It 's here /.
It 's there /.
It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.
pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.
Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.
and these are all also important stories obviously /.
but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?
Yeah /.
No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.
Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.
but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.
If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.
Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.
so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.
These are huge stakes involved /.
And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.
And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.
The slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow the whole Iraqi navy would collapse /.
That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the White House and the Defense Department say every day /.
/.
Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /.
So you 're saying there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /.
You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day /.
Are we calling them on that /?
Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.
And a lot of numbers are thrown out /.
Eighty thousand this week we 've got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.
Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.
Where you have an Iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.
And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.
So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.
So I went down to see the navy there /.
The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.
so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.
But you take that one guy out there 's no Iraqi navy /.
and it 's true of units all over the country /.
That 's really the key /.
You say that you are angry uh that Bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /.
Are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /?
Yes /.
Absolutely because I believe this is important /.
I believe that something very big is at stake /.
We 're dealing with a Muslim Arab civilization right now that 's that 's in decline , that 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and I believe dangerous for the stability of the world /.
There 's something really important here at stake /.
and what makes me so angry at the Bush administration is not that they did n't frame the stakes /.
It is important /.
But they never never appreciated how difficult it was /.
They never prepared the army or the American people for how difficult it was /.
I mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in Pakistan a region you 're familiar with /.
Um clearly it 's become a pretty big story /.
but for the first couple days I noticed it was n't that much of a television story /.
and the reason was no pictures no video /.
No yes /.
Um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it 's in a remote part of the world /?
Uh Westerners are more interested in New Orleans than in Pakistan /?
I think all of the above /.
We 're so numbed also after Katrina and Rita /.
and now another earthquake /.
/.
It 's just become uh one natural disaster after another /.
to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it 's almost hard for a journalist to process /.
Right /.
And it was remote /.
and people are exhausted I think both viewers and reporters /.
