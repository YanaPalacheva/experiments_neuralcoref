Let me show you all two presidents Bill Clinton back in nineteen ninety three George Bush ten years later talking to the North Koreans in effect /.
And I 'm asking you to put your mind in place of a North Korean watching this /.
President Clinton President Bush /.
North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /.
We had to be very firm about it /.
We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea /.
Ash Carter both presidents making very firm resolved statements /.
if you 're in North Korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /?
Well I 'm concerned that they 're thinking that we 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /.
That 's why I think at some point you have to draw the line with the North Koreans /.
I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it 's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.
So we were better off with the agreement than without it /.
It is possible to reach agreement with the North Koreans But not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed Which is uh uh uh Americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /.
I think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /.
and as I suggested earlier I think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /.
Governor Richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.
the North Koreans watch that /.
they observe that /.
they know what their own has been /.
How do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?
The North Koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.
In your earlier segment you showed president Bush calling him a tyrant /.
But then later he called him Mister Kim Jong - Il /.
I was in North Korea when that happened /.
The North Koreans were delighted because they felt they 'd been treated with respect /.
They care deeply about protocol /.
And this is another reason why I think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of Chris Hill who again is very competent I believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which is essential Which is basically a good agreement /.
In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /.
they get food fuel energy assistance /.
Security assurances we will not topple their regime /.
That 's right /.
yeah that 's right /.
that 's in that September agreement that Chris Hill negotiated /.
My point is if it 's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong - Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we 've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /.
Ambassador Galluci based on your experience do you believe the North Koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?
At the end of the day I do n't know /.
Um but that leaves me to conclude since I really do n't know that it 's a good idea to find out /.
It 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program /.
We did that /.
and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /.
and they did give it up /.
Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.
So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other , they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /.
The only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.
We hear so much talk about Kim Jong - Il tyrant spoiled child /.
others have said madman /.
you 've been in that country five times /.
who is he /?
What is he /?
Well I 've never met him /.
I met the number two in command /.
He is the entire nation /.
he is basically a cult of personality /.
He runs everything /.
He knows everything that 's happening /.
All power flows through him /.
Uh what that causes unfortunately is an isolated North Korea /.
His people are in terrible shape economically /.
I been there five times /.
I think I 've seen one tractor /.
I see people weak and drawn out /.
they look like they need nourishment /.
A lot of people are starving there /.
They have human rights violations /.
He is a mercurial character /.
But I think he 's crazy like a fox /.
He is not somebody that is uh out of his mind /.
he may be totally unpredictable isolated /.
but he 's calculating /.
and he 's used the Fourth of July /.
every time he feels he 's backed down he moves and does something irrational /.
Uh he shoots missiles off /.
he 's done it twice /.
He cancels agreements /.
he gets the nuclear inspectors out in two thousand and two /.
This is the way he operates /.
And what we should do is take advantage of his vulnerability /.
He also is vulnerable in the sense that the country is weak economically /.
it desperately needs an elimination of sanctions /.
they need food electricity /.
He 's realistic too I believe /.
Bill Richardson Robert Gallucci Ashton Carter thank you all for a very sobering but important discussion /.
