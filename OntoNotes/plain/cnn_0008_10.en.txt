Welcome back to the second half of Reliable Sources /.
Our new time for those of you just turning in is ten AM eastern seven on the west coast /.
And we 'll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week /.
The Iraq story which the media has placed on the back burner in recent months is simmering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted /.
But are journalists getting the real story there /?
To help us scrutinize the coverage I sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times three time Pulitzer winner Tom Friedman and the author most recently of The World is Flat /.
Tom Friedman welcome /.
Good to be here Howie /.
thank you /.
The other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the New York Times you would 've led the paper with the news of recent days that a Sunni suicide bomber on Ramadan had attacked a Shiite mosque /.
Now in reality the world that you do n't rule New York Times Washington Post made that part of a larger story on Iraq /.
Uh nobody put it on the front page /.
Bad news judgement /?
Uh I think so Howie /.
I 'm not here to make a news point though /.
I 'm really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /.
I 'm a firm believer /.
How we ever going to win this war /?
We 're never going to win it by way of American intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist /.
We get lucky every once in a while /.
but there 's only {one?} way we win this war Howie is it takes a village /.
It only happens when the Sunni Muslim world basically turns people in and when the Sunni Muslim world restrains their own /.
And what was so shocking to me about this story a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of Ramadan /.
What that tells you is that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world /.
Well what is the bigger story /?
And that is a huge story /.
I think it should have been a big story /.
Why was n't /-
Is it because of Iraq fatigue /?
Um /.
I think it is yeah /.
Think it 's /-
Are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed /.
and it does n't rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /?
Right /.
Yeah and I think that 's right /.
There is Iraq fatigue /.
And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say wait a minute /.
what happened today /?
A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of Ramadan their holiest day /.
and no one says boo /.
this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately I do n't know abused the Koran people rioted in Pakistan /.
Yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being defiled /.
And I think it is a measure of how much we 've kind of lost been numbed by all of this that we do n't sit back and say wow wait a minute /.
that really crosses the line /.
and we have to call them on it even if they do n't /.
You 're recently back from Iraq /.
and you write about driving in from Kuwait /.
You were guarded by the US navy /.
and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /.
Why so /?
Um you know the south of Iraq which is where I was the area around /.
This is the safe part /.
Right exactly /.
I was in the safe district /.
I was guarded uh by the British Royal Marines actually because unfortunately they 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.
And it 's part of the general continuing insecurity of Iraq that um I 'm afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning /.
And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.
You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.
I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.
But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /.
And on that trip you put on body armor /.
their rifles were out /.
Yeah /.
Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?
You 're there /.
you 're being protected /.
and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.
Well I 'll tell you what 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.
When I worked in Lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /.
You could cross lines /.
Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.
Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.
I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.
What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.
I care passionately about this story /.
I 'm so interested in it /.
but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.
And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.
And therefore it 's limited /.
