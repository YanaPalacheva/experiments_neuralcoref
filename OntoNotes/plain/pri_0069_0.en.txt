In Haiti , Jean - Bertrand Aristide has been declared the winner in last Sunday 's controversial presidential election .
NPR 's Jerry Hadden reports .
Former President Aristide won with 92 percent of the vote according to Haitian election officials .
The sweeping victory was expected since Aristide ran virtually unopposed .
Opposition candidates boycotted the vote citing tainted legislative elections last May .
Aristide was elected President for the first time ten years ago and served just months before a military coup sent him into exile in the United States .
He now faces huge obstacles as Haiti 's leader .
His country is the poorest in the hemisphere and much of the world community has shunned him .
On Wednesday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on his organization to close its mission in Haiti citing the unstable political climate .
Though a spate of pre-election violence kept some Haitians away from the polls on Sunday , the voting itself went relatively smoothly .
