Guizhou Mao - tai Distillery , which is well - known in China and abroad , plans to implement a technology renovation project with an investment surpassing 400 million RMB to further increase the output of Mao - tai in the next three years .
In order to solve the enormous need for capital , the company is now striving to issue stock and to attempt more financing channels .
The information was revealed a few days ago by Keliang Ji , the board chairman of the Guizhou Mao - tai Distillery -LRB- Group -RRB- Company of China .
Keliang Ji said this expansion project would increase the annual output capacity of Mao - tai by 2,000 tons , reaching an output of 6,000 tons per year by 2000 .
Mao - tai , which is praised as China 's " national alcoholic drink " , has a very long history , and is called one of the world 's three famous distilled spirits , the other two being French Cognac and the UK 's Scotch whiskey .
Because the art of manufacturing Mao - tai is complicated and its production cycle is long , the output of Mao - tai is extremely limited .
The annual output only reached 1,200 tons in 1987 .
In recent years , under the support of the national Ministry of Finance and the Light Industry Headquarters , the Mao - tai Distillery invested 530 million yuan RMB to successively implement a two - phase expansion and technology renovation .
Currently , it has an annual production capacity of 4,000 tons .
In 1997 , this plant made over 4,400 tons of Mao - tai ; with sales income exceeding 500 million yuan RMB , and profit and taxes reaching 370 million RMB , both being the best levels in history .
Mao - tai , which is made in the Chishui river valley area in the northern part of Guizhou Province in southwest China , is known for its extremely special fermentation technique .
The water used comes from the Chishui river that flows over cinnabar quality soil and selectively uses such locally produced raw materials as sorghum , high quality wheat , etc. and is fermented during the period from the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival to the Double Ninth Festival .
After a total of 10 months fermentation , which requires adding material twice , distilling 7 times , fermenting 8 times , and braising and boiling 9 times , the spirit is then put into specially made earthen jars , sealed and stored for over three years .
Finally , it is finished by veteran brewers carefully mixing additives .
What makes Mao - tai even more famous is that first generation leaders of new China had used it to entertain distinguished guests such as former president Nixon of the US , Tanaka Kakuei , former prime minister of Japan , etc .
