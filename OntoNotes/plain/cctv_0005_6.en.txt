Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .
Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .
This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .
Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .
Uh-huh .
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .
Yes .
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .
Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .
Yes .
As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .
Uh-huh .
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .
If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .
Right .
Have not seen so many buses .
Right .
Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .
Yes .
