Coming up , we launch our new segment Talk Back to the Media /.
President Clinton 's former lawyer Lanny Davis takes on Sixty Minutes and ex-FBI director Louis Freeh /.
And still to come New York Times columnist Tom Friedman /.
Welcome back /.
In our new Talk Back to the Media segment someone who believes he or she 's been treated unfairly by the press gets the chance to sound off and give their side of the controversy /.
Last Sunday Mike Wallace sat down with Louis Freeh who 's peddling a memoir on Sixty Minutes /.
and the former FBI director unloaded on the President who appointed him Bill Clinton /.
Among his criticisms the former president 's handling of the nineteen ninety - six Khobar Towers terrorist bombing that killed nineteen US marines in Saudi Arabia /.
I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /.
to give that order to the director because that 's the order that I got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /.
The Clinton people were furious at the way Sixty Minutes hailed the segment /.
and here to talk back is former Clinton White House attorney Lanny Davis /.
Welcome /.
Let 's deal with the substance first /.
Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety - eight , he did n't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library /.
Well not only is that false and President Clinton has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including Louis Freeh says it 's false /.
And my problem with Sixty Minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.
Until Friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.
And even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict Mister Freeh /.
Sixty Minutes says Bill Clinton was offered a chance to come on and give his rebuttal /.
What 's wrong with that /?
Well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that Sixty Minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.
This is a terrible charge that an FBI investigation was thwarted because President Clinton wanted to receive money for his library /.
The charge was false /.
and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States /?
What about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?
What about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?
That 's my problem /.
What about Sandy Berger the former national security advisor under President Clinton /?
He was at the meeting /.
He was in the room /.
Did you offer him for an on - camera interview /?
Well on Friday afternoon /.
You were n't there /.
I was not there /.
You 're good on television /.
but you were n't there /.
uh I talked to Sandy Berger /.
We issued a statement from Mister Berger /.
but this was Friday afternoon when we first learned about it with Sunday broadcast /.
Why did n't Sixty Minutes invite Mister Berger or other people at the meeting before Friday afternoon /?
Why did it take us to get Sixty Minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /?
It 's not enough to have Louis Freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.
That 's poor journalism /.
